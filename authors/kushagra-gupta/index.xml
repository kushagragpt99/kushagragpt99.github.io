      <title>Bayesian equation selection with spike and slab priors</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Often the underlying system of differential equations driving a stochastic dynamical system is assumed to be known, with inference conditioned on this assumption. We present a Bayesian framework for discovering this system of differential equations under assumptions that align with real-life scenarios, including the availability of relatively sparse data. Further, we discuss computational strategies that are critical in teasing out the important details about the dynamical system and algorithmic innovations to solve for acute parameter interdependence in the absence of rich data. This gives a complete Bayesian pathway for model identification via a variable selection paradigm and parameter estimation of the corresponding model using only the observed data. We present detailed computations and analysis of the Lorenz-96, Lorenz-63, and the Orstein-Uhlenbeck system using the Bayesian framework we propose.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Replicated Batch Means for Parallel MCMC</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sufficient research has been done on estimating the asymptotic covariance matrix in a Markov chain central limit theorem for applications in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). However, almost all of it, including the efficient batch means (BM) estimator, focuses on a single-chain MCMC run. We demonstrate that simply averaging covariance matrix estimators from different chains (average BM) can yield critical underestimates of the variance in small sample sizes, especially for slow mixing Markov chains.  We propose a multivariate replicated batch means (RBM) estimator that utilizes information across all chains in order to estimate the asymptotic covariance matrix, thereby correcting for the underestimation. Under weak conditions on the mixing rate of the process, strong consistency of the RBM estimator follows from the strong consistency of the BM estimators. Further, we show that the large-sample bias and variance of the RBM estimator mimics that of the average BM estimator. Thus, for large MCMC runs, the RBM and average BM yield equivalent performance, but for small MCMC runs, the RBM estimator can be dramatically superior. This superiority is demonstrated through a variety of examples, including a two-variable Gibbs sampler for a bivariate Gaussian target distribution. Here we obtain a closed-form expression for the asymptotic covariance matrix of the Monte Carlo estimator, a result vital in itself, as it allows for benchmarking implementations in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) allows computation directly on the encrypted data, generating an encrypted result that matches the result of the computation on decrypted data. FHE removes the insecurity introduced by the requirement of decrypting data to perform computations on it. We build a levelled FHE library (which can evaluate circuits with a bounded depth) based on the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/340&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;GSW scheme&lt;/a&gt; using libtorch and CUDA. Our library is capable of performing parallel computations and automatic differentiation, making it significantly fast and easy to use, particularly for machine learning models.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interval Regression using Bayesian Inference</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Fall 2019, I was working with Prof.Vats and Prof. Arshad Rahman (in Economics department) on developing Bayesian models for interval data. I was introduced to interval regression in my summer project on Bayesian estimation of Weibull distribution while reading Prof.Kundu&amp;rsquo;s paper on interval-censored data with Weibull lifetime. I researched on various paradigms that solve interval regression, covering quantile regression (QR), meta-heuristic algorithms, information theory, convex analysis, and set arithmetic linear models. I found QR to be a promising approach as traditional QR settings can extend to interval data in the following way - we can modify the quantile loss function to have three parts based on the partition by the interval endpoints, as opposed to a binary partition by traditional QR, with certain added assumptions. The change is that the dot product of parameters and covariates lying in the interval has a zero loss as the dependent variable can lie anywhere in the interval. The assumptions can be modelled in a Bayesian setting with appropriate priors. As part of my project, I built Bayesian frameworks for various paradigms of interval regression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bayesian Inference on 3 parameter Weibull Distribution</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2019, I (in a team of 2) was working with Prof.Kundu on developing Bayesian methodologies for parameter estimation of a 3-Weibull distribution \cite{weibull}. Maximum likelihood estimators are inconsistent and inefficient for this problem when the shape parameter is less than one due to the likelihood function exploding to infinity. However, the Bayesian setting with gamma priors solves this problem as the posterior breaks into a product of proper densities, which is convenient for MCMC sampling. We found the posterior to be log-concave and similar to a gamma distribution and, thus, approximated the parameters and confidence intervals using this observation. Our Bayesian implementation reduced the mean square errors significantly as compared to the maximum likelihood method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;I worked on multi-agent self-play in atari games in collaborative and competitive settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I used variational autoencoders to disentangle multiple near-optimal policies extracted using latent code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our initial results on the model gave win probability of 72%, which is close to 80% SOTA values, and much better than the human score of 40% in multi-agent CTF.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I worked on developing a generative model for InfoRL to maintain unsupervised setting for latent code generation to allow all standard MARL algorithms to be used with InfoRL.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our team won the silver medal in the competition. The problem involved data analysis and inference from a dataset for a globular star cluster. The datasets had the coordinates, color index (for different wavelengths) and magnitude of every star in the cluster. The task involved using the datasets appropriately to analyze the globular cluster to determine some parameters and peculiarities of the same.&lt;/p&gt;

The problem was part of the machine learning competition in inter IIT tech meet, 2018, where we won the silver medal in the competition. The task was to classify all pixels in a given satellite image, as belonging to one of nine given classes.  Our approach towards solving this challenge involved three approaches, with each approach performing better than the last one. The ﬁrst model involved the implementation of a basic U-Net architecture with custom metrics designed for this problem. The second approach involved a P-Net architecture with extensive hyperparameter tuning to improve model accuracy. The third approach utilizes nine distinct U-Net architectures for the segmentation, giving results comparable to the state of the art model for multi-class image segmentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My contributions to the project :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I designed and implemented a U-Net architecture for image segmentation of high-quality satellite images by using context-based representations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I improved the existing accuracy from 84% to 91% on just 25 images by developing a new algorithm based on 9 U-Nets using &amp;lsquo;one vs all&amp;rsquo; classification approach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I used localized optimization of parameters with high frequency to break the bottleneck of a small dataset.&lt;/li&gt;

Deep learning has revolutionized many areas of machine learning, and it is poised to do so with recommender systems as well. This project shows how deep autoencoders can be successfully trained even on relatively small amounts of data by using both well established (dropout) and scaled exponential linear units deep learning techniques. We used iterative output re-feeding - a technique which allows dense updates in collaborative ﬁltering, increases the learning rate and further improves generalization performance of the model.&lt;/p&gt;
