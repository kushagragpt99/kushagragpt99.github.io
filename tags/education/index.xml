      <description>&lt;p&gt;RStudio’s mission is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To equip everyone, regardless of means, to participate in a global economy that rewards data literacy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our education team supports this mission broadly by supporting people who want to learn R (or learn new things in R), and those who want to teach them. This website is designed for both. This website was built with Hugo, using a theme I developed and maintain. I worked with my former intern, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://desiree.rbind.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Desirée De Leon&lt;/a&gt;, to create the original artwork we used for the website.&lt;/p&gt;
