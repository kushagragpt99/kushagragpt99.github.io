      <title>Plot Twist: 10 Bake Offs, Visualized 11 Ways</title>
      <link>https://alison.rbind.io/talk/2019-rladies-sydney/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Using data from 10 series of The Great British Bake Off, we will walk through eleven ways to visualize the same data using the &lt;code&gt;ggplot2&lt;/code&gt; package. We&amp;rsquo;ll talk a lot about geoms and variable mappings, but also about what it means to &amp;ldquo;tidy your data&amp;rdquo;, plus the new pivot functions in the &lt;code&gt;tidyr&lt;/code&gt; package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You won&amp;rsquo;t need your laptops but you will get the most out of this talk if you know some basics about using &lt;code&gt;ggplot2&lt;/code&gt;. To brush up (or start learning now), you may want to play with the free RStudio.cloud 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;data visualization primer&lt;/a&gt; (you may use an existing Google or GitHub account to log in). Or of course you can check out

      <title>The Art of Literate Projecting</title>
      <link>https://alison.rbind.io/talk/2019-ysc-keynote/</link>

&lt;p&gt;“Literate programming” is an approach to writing software programs that weaves together the source code and documentation at the time of creation. The idea is to create programs that are easier for users to understand. But they are also easier for programmers to work on and maintain. In this talk, I will describe how data scientists can be inspired by this programming approach and start what I refer to as “literate projecting.” Literate projects are not only more pleasant to work on — they are also easier for others to discover and explore. In my experiences as a researcher and now a data scientist at RStudio, I’ve had the pleasure to work on many literate projects, and I’ve felt the pain of working on illiterate ones too. What is the difference? What are the benefits? Based on my experiences, I’ll share good literate projecting practices that have the potential to shift your mindset and reshape your workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Take a Sad Plot &amp; Make It Better</title>
      <link>https://alison.rbind.io/talk/2019-rladies-melbourne/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Alison will talk about one plot’s life cycle, from a sad Powerpoint slide to an Excel chart and finally to the finished product made with the ggplot2 package in R. Along the way, she will discuss why each version of the plot fails in different ways and how each iteration improved on the last one.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Teaching Students to Talk about Data Science</title>
      <link>https://alison.rbind.io/talk/2019-jsm-talk-ds/</link>

&lt;p&gt;Data science educators have a unique opportunity to teach students the skills they need in their future careers. We know that practical skills matter, like being able to wrangle, explore, analyze, and visualize data (preferably using code), but what is easy to overlook is teaching students how to communicate about data science with other people. Being able to communicate about data, code, and insights gained are important skills we can strengthen in the classroom to make a real impact on students. I will talk about three ways to help strengthen data science communication skills that matter: self-reflection, iteration, and broadcasting. Self-reflection involves asking students to reflect on concepts and/or code that they struggled with to increase engagement with materials and independent problem-solving. Iteration involves revisiting old concepts/code, identifying areas for improvement, and making them better, either independently or in collaboration with peers or other experts/advanced users. Broadcasting involves practice (practice, practice, practice) “wrapping up” code with words into coherent narratives about what a data analysis or visualization means.&lt;/p&gt;
