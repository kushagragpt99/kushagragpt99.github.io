      <title>Interval Regression using Bayesian Inference</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Fall 2019, I was working with Prof.Vats and Prof. Arshad Rahman (in Economics department) on developing Bayesian models for interval data. I was introduced to interval regression in my summer project on Bayesian estimation of Weibull distribution while reading Prof.Kundu&amp;rsquo;s paper on interval-censored data with Weibull lifetime. I researched on various paradigms that solve interval regression, covering quantile regression (QR), meta-heuristic algorithms, information theory, convex analysis, and set arithmetic linear models. I found QR to be a promising approach as traditional QR settings can extend to interval data in the following way - we can modify the quantile loss function to have three parts based on the partition by the interval endpoints, as opposed to a binary partition by traditional QR, with certain added assumptions. The change is that the dot product of parameters and covariates lying in the interval has a zero loss as the dependent variable can lie anywhere in the interval. The assumptions can be modelled in a Bayesian setting with appropriate priors. As part of my project, I built Bayesian frameworks for various paradigms of interval regression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bayesian Inference on 3 parameter Weibull Distribution</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2019, I (in a team of 2) was working with Prof.Kundu on developing Bayesian methodologies for parameter estimation of a 3-Weibull distribution \cite{weibull}. Maximum likelihood estimators are inconsistent and inefficient for this problem when the shape parameter is less than one due to the likelihood function exploding to infinity. However, the Bayesian setting with gamma priors solves this problem as the posterior breaks into a product of proper densities, which is convenient for MCMC sampling. We found the posterior to be log-concave and similar to a gamma distribution and, thus, approximated the parameters and confidence intervals using this observation. Our Bayesian implementation reduced the mean square errors significantly as compared to the maximum likelihood method.&lt;/p&gt;
