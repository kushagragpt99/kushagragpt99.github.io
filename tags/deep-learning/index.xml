&lt;p&gt;This talk was part of Programming Club, IIT Kanpur&amp;rsquo;s talk on machine learning frameworks. This talk was targeted for sophomores and junior undergraduates with some background on deep learning. It explained dataflow graphs (which represent TensorFlow computations) and its basic terminologies and functions. Next, it covered basic implementation in TensorFlow through a toy problem on MNIST dataset, including the neural network and the dataflow graph for the problem. It also covered the installation procedure of the GPU and the CPU-only version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This talk was part of Programming Club, IIT Kanpur&amp;rsquo;s talk on introduction to deep learning. This talk was targeted for freshers and sophomores (both UG and PG) who are starting with machine learning. It covered topics like the most popular convex cost functions, activation functions and gradient descent, along with hands-on coding experience of these topics. It served as a medium of introducing deep learning to the campus community and as a starting step to explore more complex topics.&lt;/p&gt;
