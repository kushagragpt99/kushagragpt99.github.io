      <title>How I Taught Tidymodels, Virtually</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I wrapped up teaching 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tidymodels.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;tidymodels&lt;/a&gt; for the third time. We say third time&amp;rsquo;s the charm, right? Even during a global pandemic? I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but this time around was fun in new ways and hard in new ways, so I wanted to take the time to write some thoughts down about how it went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;but-why&#34;&gt;But why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why teach tidymodels virtually? I&amp;rsquo;ve already taught it as a 
&lt;a href=&#34;/project/tidyml&#34;&gt;2-day workshop&lt;/a&gt; at rstudio::conf(2020). I had already agreed to teach intro to machine learning with tidymodels as a full-day workshop for the Cascadia R Conf (which unfortunately was cancelled due to COVID), and the 
&lt;a href=&#34;/talk/2020-rmedicine-tidyml/&#34;&gt;R / Medicine conference&lt;/a&gt; (still on, and 100% virtual!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had three main goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, I wanted to do a good job for the R / Medicine conference workshop in August. This seemed like an interesting teaching challenge. One of the best compliments I&amp;rsquo;ve ever gotten from a colleague is that I &amp;ldquo;teach with heart&amp;rdquo; — so the challenge was, can a virtual workshop have a ❤️?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/RAAEmgtmiR3Fe/giphy.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, given current events, I saw an opportunity to document a good system (tooling + pedagogy + logistics) around virtual workshops. I don&amp;rsquo;t see them going away anytime soon. My colleague, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Greg Wilson&lt;/a&gt;, had also been giving our 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;RStudio certified instructor&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13ohFt3D0EJ5PDbMaWTxnHH-hwA7G0IvY&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;workshops virtually&lt;/a&gt; for over a year, so I trusted that he could help me navigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, help out the R / Medicine conference organizers. My partner-in-crime for this particular workshop, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/kadauke&amp;#43;stephan/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dr. Stephan Kadauke&lt;/a&gt;, wanted to join me for some reconnaissance work. He is one of the conference organizers and will be leading his own workshop there, so he wanted to test out the tooling and the pedagogy too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we thought, three birds, one stone: I get to pilot a much shorter version of my conf workshop materials, we get to test doing it virtually, and the R / Medicine conference organizers learn how this could all work in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/oVP8LBbOv57S8/giphy.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-we-planned-it&#34;&gt;How we planned it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting out, I knew I had two main hurdles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shaving two days of workshop content into &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logistics (like figuring out what &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; should be!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first decision based on conversations with Greg was to offer the workshop across two half-days. This is how the RStudio instructor training is timed, and it works well because there are few people who can (or want to) be tied up for a full day, especially if under stay-at-home orders. We asked Stephan if his group at the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.chop.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Children&amp;rsquo;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP)&lt;/a&gt; would be up for two 4-hour sessions. Stephan&amp;rsquo;s feedback was yes, but given that these folks at CHOP typically have weekly schedules, having two consecutive days would not work. So we opted for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two 4-hour sessions that were&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exactly one week apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in Oregon, they were in Philly, so we decided to start at 9am my time (1pm for them) and wrap up at 1pm my time (5pm for them). After making this call, and again with Greg&amp;rsquo;s sage advice to 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/03/teaching-online-on-short-notice/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;take a break every hour&lt;/a&gt;, I started working on a rough schedule. I had about 8 hours total to work with; about half of my conf workshop. We decided on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50 minute chunks, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10 minute breaks at 10 till the hour every single hour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t try to make sure my materials for each session filled exactly 50 minutes. Instead, I promised the group that I would break wherever I was at the same time, and after each break we just picked up where left off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here was the new topic outline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-1&#34;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://tmv.netlify.app/slides/00-intro&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Session 00:&lt;/a&gt; Intro (include a tooling tour- orient to Google doc + Zoom)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://tmv.netlify.app/slides/01-model&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Session 01:&lt;/a&gt; Build a model (mainly parsnip package)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://tmv.netlify.app/slides/02-resample&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Session 02:&lt;/a&gt; Resample a model (add rsample package, plus tune package for &lt;code&gt;fit_resamples()&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://tmv.netlify.app/slides/03-recipes&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Session 03:&lt;/a&gt; Build a better training set (add recipes and workflows packages)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;day-2&#34;&gt;Day 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://tmv.netlify.app/slides/04-ensemble&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Session 04:&lt;/a&gt; Build an ensemble model (back to parsnip, now with model arguments)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://tmv.netlify.app/slides/05-tune&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Session 05:&lt;/a&gt; Tune a model (heavy tune package)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://tmv.netlify.app/slides/06-case-study&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Session 06:&lt;/a&gt; The Great Model-Off (a Kaggle-like group activity)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final decision was about tooling. Luckily, Greg had advice here too. We went with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google doc as the &amp;ldquo;home page&amp;rdquo; + chat (no workshop website!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RStudio Cloud for all exercises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zoom for video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pre-workshop-launch-list&#34;&gt;Pre-workshop launch list&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make shared Google doc and prepopulate with: Zoom link, RStudio Cloud link, bulleted list of participant names (be sure to make this &lt;em&gt;editable&lt;/em&gt; for anyone!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Email everyone with a Google calendar invite that includes the Zoom link and a link to a shared Google doc (be sure to make this &lt;em&gt;editable&lt;/em&gt; for anyone!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask everyone to fill in their 2-sentence bios ahead of time to ensure that you&amp;rsquo;ve done this correctly!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zoom link and the Google doc link should be the &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; links that attendees see ahead of time. Then, the Google doc is the one true source for everything. Too many links at first leads to confusion later. I also prepopulated the doc with my session outline with HTML links to each session&amp;rsquo;s slide deck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;actual-launch&#34;&gt;Actual launch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Zoom, I set it up to 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/203435537-Mute-All-And-Unmute-All&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;mute everyone&lt;/a&gt; as they joined. We started with an 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://tmv.netlify.app/slides/00-intro&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;orientation&lt;/a&gt; of the tools, the schedule, and the general plan for how they would work and interact with each other. We tried to keep questions per session in the Google doc, which my TA Stephan fielded in real time, which now is a great resource for me as I prepare for this again in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I should have done:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a Code of Conduct. I will next time. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have any issues, but what came up later was that I asked participants to turn on their cameras. I wished that part of my Code of Conduct was that we would not videotape or take screenshots at any point to protect the privacy of all participants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asked folks to make sure they had an updated version of Zoom. In particular, some newer security issues have been addressed recently, so this is nice for everyone to take advantage of. Plus the interface looked different for some.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Locked down the Zoom room. After a few minutes of starting, it was super distracting to have late arrivals who kept sending me personal chats asking for the links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In addition to locking down after the first 10-15 minutes, I also should have assigned my TA as a 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206330935-Enabling-and-adding-a-co-host&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;co-host&lt;/a&gt;, so that he could have helped me manage that. We did this on day 2 and it worked great.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-did-it-go&#34;&gt;How did it go?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to lie here. The first session of teaching spooked me a bit. This was because all attendees left their videos off and I felt like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/AEMyf9Oj6MpS8/giphy.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was eerie to teach to a silent void. On day 2, I asked for two volunteers to turn on their cameras for a single 50 minute block each because it really helped me to see faces. Participants probably kept their own view as &amp;ldquo;speaker only&amp;rdquo;, but for me it really helped to be able to have some human feedback, even if they were muted. Much love to the head nodders out there. This conversation on day 2 broke my heart though, because several participants indicated they felt they couldn&amp;rsquo;t turn on their cameras because they had young children at home. It is &lt;strong&gt;hard&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the participants didn&amp;rsquo;t sense my discomfort at all. In fact, I heard from several that it was nice to see me up close and so personal. It actually felt &lt;em&gt;more personal&lt;/em&gt; than a large in-person workshop, to my surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On day 1, I started by asking participants to use Zoom reactions (like thumbs up) to answer questions, give me progress updates, etc. I ended up retiring this- it was distracting and the reactions disappear so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually useful. Instead, I asked people to use the Zoom chat to indicate &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo; or give quick one-word answers (a or b, yes or no).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan also had a great idea for the breaks. On day 2, I started using Garrick Aden-Buie&amp;rsquo;s 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/countdown/#29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;countdown app&lt;/a&gt; to show the 10 minute break countdown full-screen. I used the hosted version 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.garrickadenbuie.com/countdown/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-can-i-do-better&#34;&gt;What can I do better?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logistically, I got really frustrated because I kept losing my Zoom meeting controls. Later I found out about this accessibility setting, which would have helped!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;zoom-controls.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More substantively, as I mentioned, I would have a Code of Conduct at the very beginning. I also think virtual workshops offer a unique opportunity to include some more creative exercise types. Here are a few I brainstormed with Greg Wilson after the fact—expect to see these at R / Medicine if you attend with me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spot the bug- do in groups&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unscramble code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Predict what is going to happen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fill in the blank with the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/05/flair/#example-3--mask-code-for-easy-practice-activities&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;flair package&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/13eay0HFG25jy0/giphy.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;verdict&#34;&gt;Verdict&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transitioning from primarily teaching in person to teaching virtually is &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;m in awe of 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/05/remote-roundup/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;all the instructors&lt;/a&gt; I know who have had to do this on very short notice. But, can it be done with heart? Yes, I think so ❤️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/v9tIehXauaCbK/giphy.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;thanks&#34;&gt;Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the participants, who were the loveliest guinea pigs. It is a hard time to learn and a hard time to find time. I appreciate that you took time out of your lives to spend 8 hours with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks also to 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://third-bit.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Greg Wilson&lt;/a&gt; for his support, and 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.chop.edu/doctors/kadauke-stephan&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Stephan Kadauke&lt;/a&gt; for being an awesome co-pilot. Extra special thanks to 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://desiree.rbind.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Desirée De Leon&lt;/a&gt;, who has the biggest heart of all. Knowing that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time for creativity with my slides, she surprised me with the most beautiful xaringan slide deck theme based on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tidymodels.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;tidymodels.org&lt;/a&gt;. I merged in her PR &lt;em&gt;with glee and delight&lt;/em&gt;, I know the participants felt those same emotions too (while learning about machine learning, no less!) 🌼&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;feedback&#34;&gt;Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are curious, here is some of the feedback I collected at the bottom of our Google doc:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;two-half-days&#34;&gt;Two half days?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;worked well for me. A full day would be tough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worked well for me also and I also think having all in one day would be a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;worked well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;worked well for me too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;separated-by-one-week&#34;&gt;Separated by one week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;seemed fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I liked this!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;good. Enough time to digest the previous session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pace-too-fast-too-slow&#34;&gt;Pace: too fast, too slow?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;good pace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I liked the pace. It felt like we covered a lot of ground quickly, but also like we have great resources to come back to for refreshing on what we learned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;good pace, except at “data leakage”. I still have hard time to understand that part.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;good pace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scope-too-small-too-big&#34;&gt;Scope: too small, too big?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nice scope&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nice scope&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;very nice and practical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nice scope.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;timing-in-50-min-chunks-too-many-or-too-few-breaks&#34;&gt;Timing in 50 min chunks: too many or too few breaks?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 50 min chunks were great! I thought perfect length.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perfect break up. And the 10 min breaks gave enough time to make tea, grab a snack, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am fine with that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;works well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;timed-code-exercises-too-easy-too-hard&#34;&gt;Timed code exercises: too easy, too hard?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neither, I thought they were appropriate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-between-homeworkreading&#34;&gt;In-between homework/reading?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;maybe some light reading or practice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In theory I think I would have liked some ‘homework’, but the week turned out to be so busy that I don’t know if I would’ve made time to complete it before the workshop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;will be helpful to give some reading about different model descriptions in-between.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;final-take-home-project---feedback&#34;&gt;Final take-home project (+/- feedback)?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;optional&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think this could be fun if we had access to a few different datasets to choose from. With maybe some pointers on what to look out for as we explore the data. Is it unbalanced? Could any two variables be collinear? Etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i would vote for take-home project to play with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;zoom-video-onoff&#34;&gt;Zoom: video on/off?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I find video distracting while working/listening/learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like being able to see the presenter/speaker’s video. I tend to choose “Speaker View” so that I don’t see all the participant videos (which I would find distracting).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;i am fine with either. I know, from the speaker’s perspective, it will be good to have video on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think it was nice and respectful to ask volunteers to turn video on part time! (Kudos to Stephan for having it on the whole time!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;google-doc-as-our-home-page-and-discussion-forum&#34;&gt;Google doc as our “home page” and “discussion forum”?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes! I thought it was a really helpful tool and ‘homebase’ to come to for all of the things (slides, R Studio Cloud project, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;very good! Much easier to track.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;works!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rstudiocloud&#34;&gt;Rstudio.cloud?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pretty good except for crashing at end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ditto.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I really enjoyed using R Studio Cloud. It makes it easier when I don’t have to worry about pre-installing packages or updating my version of R in order to go into a workshop. Having everything already set up for you in there is super convenient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like Rstudio cloud generally. Just not suitable for complicated model training.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>How I Teach R Markdown</title>
      <link>/post/2020-05-28-how-i-teach-r-markdown/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 28 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Ah, &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/&#34;&gt;R Markdown&lt;/a&gt;. I love teaching R Markdown. But this was not a love at first sight story. When I first started teaching with R at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University many moons ago, my students used R Markdown for their homework assignments and in-class labs. This is a great way to start for beginners, to be honest- just use it! I found that most people are not very disoriented by a file that mixes text and code; a concern I had at first and one that I’ve heard voiced by other educators. It seems natural to use if it is your first exposure to &lt;em&gt;all the data science things&lt;/em&gt;, especially if you’ve never used an R script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did notice, though, that over the course of even just a few weeks, many of my students would reach unbearable levels of R Markdown curiosity. I would see signs of growing pains in their assignments, like how can I turn off these messages and warnings when I load packages? This is so long- how can I make it easier to find things? How can I make it look &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all learners, there comes an uncomfortable point where you simply cannot just continue to use this awesome tool without learning how to use it. And I realized when I was teaching that ultimately it was unfair of me to assume that they would just learn an entire ecosystem while I stood idly by, clutching the secrets of being an &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sharlagelfand/status/1114264529477799937?s=20&#34;&gt;“R Markdown Whisperer”&lt;/a&gt; close to my chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like, &lt;strong&gt;why can’t you just find the piñata, kid&lt;/strong&gt;? But more importantly, what happens when you can’t? I think the risk is that learners either won’t like or won’t appreciate a tool that I genuinely &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.rstudio.com/t/convince-me-to-start-using-r-markdown/1636/7&#34;&gt;think would make their working lives better&lt;/a&gt;. If I believed it was worth their time to use it, it was worth my time to teach it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/xFcFJAryrhO6s/giphy.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So like any good educator, I evolved. I decided that the next year, I would teach R Markdown. And I did. I went from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just use it”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/pHiWkDofYnRv2/giphy.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just tell them how to use it already”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7TKvFKwclJQDY30A/giphy.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I waited until a few weeks into a quarter, and I spent a full lab period walking students through “Hey- this bit where you put the title of each assignment and your name? That’s called YAML! Here is what it does…” I showed them how to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html#appearance-and-style&#34;&gt;bootswatch themes&lt;/a&gt;, make a &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html#table-of-contents&#34;&gt;floating table of contents&lt;/a&gt;, control their output using the power of &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/r-code.html&#34;&gt;knitr&lt;/a&gt; code chunks and chunk options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess what happened? The next batch of assignment my TA team and I received were…stunning. Creative. Beautiful. Thoughtful and thought-provoking. Students had taken care with their markdown headers, they played with flatly/yeti/united, they cared about not printing the giant output of a code chunk. It was a thing of beauty. I remember one of my beloved TAs, &lt;a href=&#34;https://grace.rbind.io/&#34;&gt;Grace Lawley&lt;/a&gt;, commenting that one star student’s homework “brought tears to her eyes” (and yes, I trained Grace too as she was also my research assistant, so she was already baptized into the R Markdown family).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I have to admit, the first time I taught it, I had a hard time teaching it! I realized that I lacked vocabulary around things I used everyday, but had never really talked about out loud with anyone &lt;em&gt;in words&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in my role at RStudio, I’ve devoted a lot of time and energy trying to figure out how we can make R Markdown easier- easier to discover, easier to debug, easier to use, and easier to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So without further ado, here are some of my guiding principles when introducing R Markdown to beginners, for those who are ready to go beyond casual knitter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it. Make it again.&lt;/strong&gt; Knit early. Knit often. That means starting with a pre-filled Rmd document usually that you know &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; knit. How do you motivate repeated knitting and make it satisfying? Teach the basics of output formats and options by editing mainly the YAML. Your goal is to show how small effort –&amp;gt; high polish. For single docs, I love &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;html_document()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with a floating table of contents and a theme (like &lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio-education.github.io/sharing-short-notice/#24&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;), switching quickly to &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/bookdown-output.html#a-single-document&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;bookdown::html_document2()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;code&gt;distill::distill_article()&lt;/code&gt;. The latter two also enable automated figure numbering, which for scientific audiences is quite nice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;You can do something like this with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/rmarkdown?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#rmarkdown&lt;/a&gt;. Ask students to knit to HTML, then use the bootswatch themes &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/J9ucdRWnIl&#34;&gt;https://t.co/J9ucdRWnIl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bonus: you get the prettiest &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#rstats&lt;/a&gt; homeworks after this! 💐🖍️&lt;br&gt;---&lt;br&gt;title: &amp;quot;Habits&amp;quot; &lt;br&gt;output:   &lt;br&gt;    html_document:     &lt;br&gt;         theme: flatly&lt;br&gt;--- &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/wMQ3Uqhc7s&#34;&gt;https://t.co/wMQ3Uqhc7s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Alison Presmanes Hill (@apreshill) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/apreshill/status/1101866080996212736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;March 2, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonus when using a &lt;code&gt;theme&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;html_document()&lt;/code&gt;: show off the &lt;code&gt;code_download&lt;/code&gt; output option!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;TIL you can embed a &amp;quot;code download&amp;quot; button in an HTML &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/rmarkdown?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#rmarkdown&lt;/a&gt; doc so that users can click to download your source .Rmd from the rendered HTML version...without GitHub 🤩 &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#rstats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;YAML:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;---&lt;br&gt;output:&lt;br&gt;  html_document:&lt;br&gt;    code_download: true&lt;br&gt;---&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Test: &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/bp7w7XKF8b&#34;&gt;https://t.co/bp7w7XKF8b&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/uMQK0mvYcF&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/uMQK0mvYcF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Alison Presmanes Hill (@apreshill) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/apreshill/status/1108925218850893832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;March 22, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it pretty.&lt;/strong&gt; The starting Rmd should have a nice &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/&#34;&gt;ggplot2&lt;/a&gt; graphic in there, and maybe a pretty &lt;a href=&#34;https://gt.rstudio.com/&#34;&gt;gt&lt;/a&gt; table too. This is a motivational, aspirational document! I also try to use local data sets, so they can see how that actually works, as opposed to using a data package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Never underestimate the power of being able to make pretty &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#rstats&lt;/a&gt; things. ⬆️ polish/effort ratio ➡️ happier users 🦚 &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/LMbFRUiuLa&#34;&gt;https://t.co/LMbFRUiuLa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Alison Presmanes Hill (@apreshill) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/apreshill/status/1101978567842291712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;March 2, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it snappy&lt;/strong&gt;. I aim to get to a shareable link in the first 20 minutes (at most!). I like to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.netlify.com/drop&#34;&gt;Netlify Drop&lt;/a&gt; for this. No account sign-up needed, and everyone knows how to drag-and-drop (see video below). It is very satisfying to get a link they can share with their mom/best friend/arch nemesis (kidding). I like to have everyone drop their links in a chat too, like a Slack, Google Doc, or a Gitter channel if doing a workshop. My favorite motto: &lt;em&gt;“if it knits, it ships”&lt;/em&gt; 🚢&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://rstudio-education.github.io/sharing-short-notice/images/single-doc-dnd.mp4&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; height=&#34;400px&#34;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it real.&lt;/strong&gt; Teach folks what they need to know to actually use the tool productively in real life. If you are an avid R Markdown user, this means that you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; without a doubt that file paths will eventually be painful, for example. At the end of an intro, I go back and highlight things I just used to make sure they notice them like R Projects and the here package for data importing. I also love a good &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmd4medicine.netlify.app/slides/01-rmd-anatomy.html#77&#34;&gt;“Your Turn”&lt;/a&gt; exercise where you get a fresh data dump and all they have to do is re-knit. As in, “Surprise! Now instead of 3 sites, you have data from all 6 sites- what do you do?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make it easy.&lt;/strong&gt; People will only keep using R Markdown if they see it making their life easier. So show them how. For example, the RStudio IDE has some very nice built-in features that make it much easier to be an R Markdown user. I point out things having a &lt;a href=&#34;https://apreshill.github.io/rmd4cdc/#112&#34;&gt;global setup chunk&lt;/a&gt;, and IDE features like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://rmd4medicine.netlify.app/slides/images/rmd-nav.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do I save until later?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rendering with &lt;code&gt;render()&lt;/code&gt;. I think knitting in the RStudio IDE can get you very far- this I consider an intermediate to advanced concept that is confusing if introduced too early. I’ve never heard someone say &lt;em&gt;“Well there is this simple button, but how can I do the same thing from the command line?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/parameterized-reports.html&#34;&gt;Parameterized reports&lt;/a&gt;. I actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; use parameters though! I’ll have at least one or two often in one of my Rmds, and mention them briefly in my wrap-up. I teach parameters explicitly with actual exercises when I have &amp;gt; 1 hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple Rmd output formats. I tend to start with single output formats first. If I have &amp;gt; 1.5 hours and it matches my learning objectives, then I happily oblige- I love teaching &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/books.html&#34;&gt;bookdown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/websites.html&#34;&gt;blogdown&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html&#34;&gt;distill websites&lt;/a&gt;. But to start, I stay single.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Markdown. I skim markdown, and always provide a link to an interactive tutorial. This &lt;a href=&#34;https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/&#34;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; is my favorite. Teaching markdown can be…dry. I show some bits on the slides because I cannot count on everyone doing the interactive tutorial ahead of time, but I do not linger much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/U7Uxq9Lyz02oStvUIE/giphy.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are curious to see some of the materials I’ve used to teach R Markdown, click on the &lt;code&gt;rmarkdown&lt;/code&gt; button just below this post! 🚀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But remember: there is no one way to learn R Markdown, and no one way to teach it either. I love seeing the creativity of the community when introducing the R Markdown family- so keep them coming!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Take a Sad Script &amp; Make it Better: Tidymodels Edition</title>
      <link>/post/2020-02-27-better-tidymodels/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/post/2020-02-27-better-tidymodels/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I did a talk called 
&lt;a href=&#34;/talk/2018-ohsu-sad-plot-better/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Take a Sad Plot &amp;amp; Make it Better,&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; where I showed how I took a single sad plot and tried to make it better. The process of making that plot better taught me a lot about data visualization, and about the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ggplot2 package&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to 2019 when I started learning 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tidymodels/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;tidymodels&lt;/a&gt;, and I have accumulated some pretty sad predictive modeling scripts! And my sad plots are not so lonely anymore. Specifically, my old scripts for doing cross-validation with tidymodels are particularly sad. But, I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to make them better (one might even call them happy), primarily due to changes in the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://tidymodels.github.io/tune/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;tune package&lt;/a&gt; and the addition of the &lt;code&gt;fit_resamples()&lt;/code&gt; function. The process of making these scripts better taught me a lot about predictive modeling, and about the (evolving) tidymodels ecosystem. So, why write a blog post with outdated code?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to remember &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; I did this &amp;ldquo;by hand.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to remember &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; I did this &amp;ldquo;by hand.&amp;rdquo; The code still works, even if there is now a happier path to doing the same thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to share cute penguin art and gifs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with some 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.greenhumour.com/2018/04/penguins-of-world.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;cute penguin art&lt;/a&gt; by Rohan Chakravarty&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My objective here is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; to provide an introduction to using tidymodels, cross-validation, or to machine learning. If that is what you came for, check out the project button at the top of this post for my workshop materials for learners, and my

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not the first person to write sad tidymodels scripts- there are many out in the wild. Here were the blog posts that I found most helpful when trying to solve this particular coding conundrum:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Update!&lt;/strong&gt; We have bundled the Palmer Station penguins data into an R data package named palmerpenguins. Enjoy 🐧 Here is the package website: &lt;a href=&#34;https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/&#34;&gt;https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you&amp;rsquo;ve installed the package, load it and read about the variables with &lt;code&gt;?penguins&lt;/code&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;ll modify this dataset lightly by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;casting all characters as factors,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dropping any observations with missing data, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dropping the &lt;code&gt;island&lt;/code&gt; variable.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This data included structural size measurements of penguins like their bill length, flipper length, and body mass. It also included each penguin&amp;rsquo;s species and sex. I&amp;rsquo;m going to use this data to try to predict penguin body mass. Sadly, we only have data for three distinct penguin species:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;tidypenguins %&amp;gt;% 
  count(species)
#&amp;gt; # A tibble: 3 x 2

#&amp;gt; 2 Chinstrap    68
#&amp;gt; 3 Gentoo      119
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a lineup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.bas.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Penguin-heights.jpg&#34; style=&#34;display: block; margin: auto;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bas.ac.uk/about/antarctica/wildlife/penguins/&#34;&gt;https://www.bas.ac.uk/about/antarctica/wildlife/penguins/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks like we have data for 3 of the smaller penguin species (of those pictured here).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;rsquo;s build a simple linear regression model to predict body mass from flipper length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;ggplot(tidypenguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(color = &amp;quot;salmon&amp;quot;, size = 3, alpha = .9) +
  geom_smooth(method = &amp;quot;lm&amp;quot;) +
  theme_penguin()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;figs/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not bad! Looks promising. To actually fit a linear regression model, you might be used to something like this in R:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;penguin_mod &amp;lt;- lm(body_mass_g ~ flipper_length_mm, data = tidypenguins)
summary(penguin_mod)
#&amp;gt; 
#&amp;gt; Call:
#&amp;gt; lm(formula = body_mass_g ~ flipper_length_mm, data = tidypenguins)
#&amp;gt; 
#&amp;gt; Residuals:
#&amp;gt;      Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max 
#&amp;gt; -1057.33  -259.79   -12.24   242.97  1293.89 
#&amp;gt; 
#&amp;gt; Coefficients:
#&amp;gt;                   Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&amp;gt;|t|)    
#&amp;gt; (Intercept)       -5872.09     310.29  -18.93   &amp;lt;2e-16 ***
#&amp;gt; flipper_length_mm    50.15       1.54   32.56   &amp;lt;2e-16 ***
#&amp;gt; ---
#&amp;gt; Signif. codes:  0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1
#&amp;gt; 
#&amp;gt; Residual standard error: 393.3 on 331 degrees of freedom
#&amp;gt; Multiple R-squared:  0.7621,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.7614 
#&amp;gt; F-statistic:  1060 on 1 and 331 DF,  p-value: &amp;lt; 2.2e-16
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we aren&amp;rsquo;t going to stick with this. We are going to use tidymodels, with the goal of generating accurate predictions for future, yet-to-be-seen penguins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/C0EYVrLCgnYdy/giphy.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tidymodels-101&#34;&gt;tidymodels 101&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code provided in the section below is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; particularly sad 🐧. If you are embarking on learning tidymodels, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to use this same kind of code as the building blocks for any predictive modeling pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;parsnip-build-the-model&#34;&gt;Parsnip: build the model&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This step is really three, using only the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://tidymodels.github.io/parsnip/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;parsnip package&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;lm_spec &amp;lt;- 
  linear_reg() %&amp;gt;%       # pick model
  set_engine(&amp;quot;lm&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;%   # set engine
  set_mode(&amp;quot;regression&amp;quot;) # set mode

lm_spec
#&amp;gt; Linear Regression Model Specification (regression)
#&amp;gt; 
#&amp;gt; Computational engine: lm
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things that are missing: data (we haven&amp;rsquo;t touched it yet) and a formula (no data, no variables, no twiddle &lt;code&gt;~&lt;/code&gt;). This is an &lt;em&gt;abstract&lt;/em&gt; model specification. See other possible parsnip models 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://tidymodels.github.io/parsnip/articles/articles/Models.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;recipe-not-happening-here-folks&#34;&gt;Recipe: not happening here, folks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where you would normally insert some code for feature engineering using the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://tidymodels.github.io/recipes/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;recipes package&lt;/a&gt;. But previously this required functions named &lt;code&gt;prep()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bake()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;juice()&lt;/code&gt;- so I&amp;rsquo;m willfully ignoring that for now. There will be no recipes involving penguins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/H4uE6w9G1uK4M/giphy.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rsample-initial-split&#34;&gt;Rsample: initial split&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll use the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://tidymodels.github.io/rsample/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;rsample package&lt;/a&gt; to split (&lt;em&gt;ayee! I promise no penguins were hurt in the writing of this blog post&lt;/em&gt;) the penguins up into two datasets: training and testing. If you are unfamiliar with this practice, read up on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2016/model-evaluation-selection-part1.html#resubstitution-validation-and-the-holdout-method&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the holdout method&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;penguin_split &amp;lt;- initial_split(tidypenguins, strata = species)
penguin_train &amp;lt;- training(penguin_split)
penguin_test  &amp;lt;- testing(penguin_split)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fitting-the-model-once&#34;&gt;Fitting the model once&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitting a single model once is&amp;hellip;not &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; the hardest part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/4KALRmOb8uwbC/giphy.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is essentially the workflow from this 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://rviews.rstudio.com/2019/06/19/a-gentle-intro-to-tidymodels/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;early blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;set.seed(0)

lm_spec %&amp;gt;% 
  
  # train: get fitted model
  fit(body_mass_g ~ ., data = penguin_train) %&amp;gt;% 
  
  # test: get predictions
  predict(new_data = penguin_test) %&amp;gt;% 
  
  # compare: get metrics
  bind_cols(penguin_test) %&amp;gt;% 
  rmse(truth = body_mass_g, estimate = .pred)
#&amp;gt; # A tibble: 1 x 3
#&amp;gt;   .metric .estimator .estimate
#&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;          &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;
#&amp;gt; 1 rmse    standard        313.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fitting-the-model-with-a-function&#34;&gt;Fitting the model with a function&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you squint, you might see that I could make this into a function like below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;get_rmse &amp;lt;- function(model_spec, split) {
  
  model_spec %&amp;gt;% 
    
    # train: get fitted model
    fit(body_mass_g ~ ., data = training(split)) %&amp;gt;% 
    
    # test: get predictions
    predict(new_data = testing(split)) %&amp;gt;% 
    
    # compare: get metrics
    bind_cols(testing(split)) %&amp;gt;% 
    rmse(truth = body_mass_g, estimate = .pred)
  
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I could use it to fit a linear regression model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;set.seed(0)
get_rmse(model_spec = lm_spec, split = penguin_split)
#&amp;gt; # A tibble: 1 x 3
#&amp;gt;   .metric .estimator .estimate
#&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;          &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;
#&amp;gt; 1 rmse    standard        313.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could also build up a tibble that includes the results, if I wanted to save the predicted values, for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;get_preds &amp;lt;- function(model_spec, split){
  
  # train: get fitted model
  fit_model &amp;lt;- model_spec %&amp;gt;% 
    fit(body_mass_g ~ ., data = training(split))
  
  # test: get predictions
  preds &amp;lt;- fit_model %&amp;gt;% 
    predict(new_data = testing(split)) %&amp;gt;% 
    bind_cols(testing(split) %&amp;gt;% select(body_mass_g, species))

  preds
}

set.seed(0)
penguin_preds &amp;lt;- get_preds(model_spec = lm_spec, split = penguin_split)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I can work with the predicted values, like plotting the fitted body mass estimates against the residuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;ggplot(penguin_preds, aes(x = .pred, y = (.pred - body_mass_g))) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = species), size = 3, alpha = .8) +
  geom_smooth(method = &amp;quot;lm&amp;quot;) +
  theme_penguin() +
  scico::scale_colour_scico_d(end = .8) +
  ggtitle(&amp;quot;Residuals vs Fitted&amp;quot;)
#&amp;gt; `geom_smooth()` using formula &#39;y ~ x&#39;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;# regression tree model spec
rt_spec &amp;lt;-
  decision_tree() %&amp;gt;% 
  set_engine(&amp;quot;rpart&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% 
  set_mode(&amp;quot;regression&amp;quot;)

# get rmse
set.seed(0)
get_preds(model_spec = rt_spec, 
          split = penguin_split) %&amp;gt;% 
  rmse(truth = body_mass_g, estimate = .pred)
#&amp;gt; # A tibble: 1 x 3
#&amp;gt;   .metric .estimator .estimate
#&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;          &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;
#&amp;gt; 1 rmse    standard        346.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or a random forest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;# random forest model spec
rf_spec &amp;lt;-
  rand_forest() %&amp;gt;% 
  set_engine(&amp;quot;ranger&amp;quot;) %&amp;gt;% 
  set_mode(&amp;quot;regression&amp;quot;)

# get rmse
set.seed(0)
get_preds(model_spec = rf_spec, 
          split = penguin_split) %&amp;gt;% 
  rmse(truth = body_mass_g, estimate = .pred)
#&amp;gt; # A tibble: 1 x 3
#&amp;gt;   .metric .estimator .estimate
#&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;          &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;
#&amp;gt; 1 rmse    standard        322.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, unfortunately, I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be predicting with the test set over and over again like this. It isn&amp;rsquo;t good practice to predict with the test set &amp;gt; 1 time. What is a good predictive modeler to do? I should be saving (holding out) the test set and use it to generate predictions exactly once, at the very end — after I&amp;rsquo;ve compared different models, selected my features, and tuned my hyperparameters. How do you do this? You do 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2016/model-evaluation-selection-part3.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;cross-validation&lt;/a&gt; with the training set, and you leave the testing set for 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://tidymodels.github.io/tune/reference/last_fit.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;the very last fit you do&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/uwlDAujt3w9mU/giphy.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hey-jude-dont-make-it-sad-&#34;&gt;Hey Jude, don&amp;rsquo;t make it sad 🎶&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, for the 😭 part- let&amp;rsquo;s add cross-validation! To do this, we&amp;rsquo;ll use a function called 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://tidymodels.github.io/rsample/reference/vfold_cv.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;rsample::vfold_cv()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;# add the cv step here
set.seed(0)
penguin_folds &amp;lt;- vfold_cv(data = penguin_train, strata = &amp;quot;species&amp;quot;)

penguin_folds
#&amp;gt; #  10-fold cross-validation using stratification 
#&amp;gt; # A tibble: 10 x 2
#&amp;gt;    splits           id    
#&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;list&amp;gt;           &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt; 
#&amp;gt;  1 &amp;lt;split [225/26]&amp;gt; Fold01
#&amp;gt;  2 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold02
#&amp;gt;  3 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold03
#&amp;gt;  4 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold04
#&amp;gt;  5 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold05
#&amp;gt;  6 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold06
#&amp;gt;  7 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold07
#&amp;gt;  8 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold08
#&amp;gt;  9 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold09
#&amp;gt; 10 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold10
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of training, testing, and computing metrics gets a lot harder when you need to do this across 10 folds, each with a different data split. I eventually worked out three approaches, which I show below. All require some level of comfort with iteration using the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://purrr.tidyverse.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;purrr package&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;function-with-minimal-purrr-ing&#34;&gt;Function with minimal purrr-ing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach is essentially a mega-function, that we then use purrr to map across each fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to change a few things from my previous &lt;code&gt;get_preds()&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;training(split)&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;analysis(split)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;testing(split)&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;assessment(split)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also added the &lt;code&gt;rsample::add_resample_id()&lt;/code&gt; function to keep track of the fold number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I saved the predictions now as a list column.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build up this function, my strategy was to figure out how to work with one fold, then I knew I&amp;rsquo;d be able to use &lt;code&gt;purrr::map_df()&lt;/code&gt; to apply it across multiple folds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;# Figure it out for one fold
get_fold_results &amp;lt;- function(model_spec, split){
  
  # train: get fitted model for each fold
  fits &amp;lt;- model_spec %&amp;gt;% 
    fit(body_mass_g ~ ., data = analysis(split))
  
  # test: get predictions on for each fold
  preds &amp;lt;- fits %&amp;gt;% 
    predict(new_data = assessment(split)) %&amp;gt;% 
    bind_cols(assessment(split)) 
  
  # compare: compute metric for each fold
  rmse &amp;lt;- assessment(split)  %&amp;gt;% 
    summarize(rmse = rmse_vec(truth = body_mass_g, 
                              estimate = preds$.pred))
  
  rmse %&amp;gt;% 
    # add fold identifier column
    rsample::add_resample_id(split = split) %&amp;gt;% 
    as_tibble() %&amp;gt;% 
    # add predictions
    mutate(preds = list(preds))
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried this function with a single fold first:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;set.seed(0)
get_fold_results(
    split      = penguin_folds$splits[[1]], 
    model_spec = rt_spec
  )
#&amp;gt; # A tibble: 1 x 3
#&amp;gt;    rmse id     preds            
#&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;list&amp;gt;           
#&amp;gt; 1  301. Fold01 &amp;lt;tibble [26 x 8]&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I used purrr- but just once. The function &lt;code&gt;get_fold_results&lt;/code&gt; is doing &lt;strong&gt;most&lt;/strong&gt; of the work for us, but I needed purrr to map it across each fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;set.seed(0)
kfold_results &amp;lt;- 
  map_df(
    penguin_folds$splits, 
    ~get_fold_results(.x, model = rt_spec))
kfold_results
#&amp;gt; # A tibble: 10 x 3
#&amp;gt;     rmse id     preds            
#&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;list&amp;gt;           
#&amp;gt;  1  301. Fold01 &amp;lt;tibble [26 x 8]&amp;gt;
#&amp;gt;  2  337. Fold02 &amp;lt;tibble [25 x 8]&amp;gt;
#&amp;gt;  3  250. Fold03 &amp;lt;tibble [25 x 8]&amp;gt;
#&amp;gt;  4  330. Fold04 &amp;lt;tibble [25 x 8]&amp;gt;
#&amp;gt;  5  352. Fold05 &amp;lt;tibble [25 x 8]&amp;gt;
#&amp;gt;  6  333. Fold06 &amp;lt;tibble [25 x 8]&amp;gt;
#&amp;gt;  7  255. Fold07 &amp;lt;tibble [25 x 8]&amp;gt;
#&amp;gt;  8  275. Fold08 &amp;lt;tibble [25 x 8]&amp;gt;
#&amp;gt;  9  287. Fold09 &amp;lt;tibble [25 x 8]&amp;gt;
#&amp;gt; 10  325. Fold10 &amp;lt;tibble [25 x 8]&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we are still left with 10 RMSE values- one for each of the 10 folds. We don&amp;rsquo;t care too much about by fold- the power is in the aggregate. Specifically, we mainly care about the central tendency and spread of these RMSE values. Let&amp;rsquo;s finish by combining (or aggregating) these metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;kfold_results %&amp;gt;% 
  summarize(mean_rmse = mean(rmse), sd_rmse = sd(rmse))
#&amp;gt; # A tibble: 1 x 2
#&amp;gt;   mean_rmse sd_rmse
#&amp;gt;       &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;
#&amp;gt; 1      305.    36.2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this works. But, can you imagine doing it again? Without errors? Can you imagine teaching it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This approach is &lt;code&gt;purrr::map()&lt;/code&gt; (and friends) on steriods. We use vanilla &lt;code&gt;map()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;map2()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;map2_dbl()&lt;/code&gt; here. We also use

&lt;p&gt;Another way I worked out was largely after reviewing Max&amp;rsquo;s slides from previous workshops. This is basically a mash-up of my previous two approaches, where we write laser-focused functions that each do one thing, then use purrr to apply those functions across the folds. This way is nice(r) for showing in slides as you can incrementally build up the results table. Let&amp;rsquo;s see this sad script in action&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

#&amp;gt;  5 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold05 &amp;lt;fit[+]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tibble [25 x 8]&amp;gt;    352.
#&amp;gt;  6 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold06 &amp;lt;fit[+]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tibble [25 x 8]&amp;gt;    333.

#&amp;gt;  9 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold09 &amp;lt;fit[+]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tibble [25 x 8]&amp;gt;    287.
#&amp;gt; 10 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold10 &amp;lt;fit[+]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tibble [25 x 8]&amp;gt;    325.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, summarizing as I did before:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;penguin_purrr %&amp;gt;% 
  summarize(mean_rmse = mean(rt_rmse), sd_rmse = sd(rt_rmse))
#&amp;gt; # A tibble: 1 x 2
#&amp;gt;   mean_rmse sd_rmse
#&amp;gt;       &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;
#&amp;gt; 1      305.    36.2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, if you did all these at once instead of incrementally, it would look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;set.seed(0)
penguin_folds %&amp;gt;% 
  
  # train: get fitted model for a split
  mutate(rt_fits = map(splits, get_fits, rt_spec)) %&amp;gt;% 
  
  # test: get predictions on for each fold
  mutate(rt_preds = map2(splits, rt_fits, get_preds)) %&amp;gt;% 
  
  # compare: compute metric for each fold
  mutate(rt_rmse = map_dbl(rt_preds, get_rmse))
#&amp;gt; #  10-fold cross-validation using stratification 
#&amp;gt; # A tibble: 10 x 5
#&amp;gt;    splits           id     rt_fits  rt_preds          rt_rmse
#&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;list&amp;gt;           &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;list&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;list&amp;gt;              &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;
#&amp;gt;  1 &amp;lt;split [225/26]&amp;gt; Fold01 &amp;lt;fit[+]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tibble [26 x 8]&amp;gt;    301.
#&amp;gt;  2 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold02 &amp;lt;fit[+]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tibble [25 x 8]&amp;gt;    337.
#&amp;gt;  3 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold03 &amp;lt;fit[+]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tibble [25 x 8]&amp;gt;    250.
#&amp;gt;  4 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold04 &amp;lt;fit[+]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tibble [25 x 8]&amp;gt;    330.
#&amp;gt;  5 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold05 &amp;lt;fit[+]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tibble [25 x 8]&amp;gt;    352.
#&amp;gt;  6 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold06 &amp;lt;fit[+]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tibble [25 x 8]&amp;gt;    333.
#&amp;gt;  7 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold07 &amp;lt;fit[+]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tibble [25 x 8]&amp;gt;    255.
#&amp;gt;  8 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold08 &amp;lt;fit[+]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tibble [25 x 8]&amp;gt;    275.
#&amp;gt;  9 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold09 &amp;lt;fit[+]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tibble [25 x 8]&amp;gt;    287.
#&amp;gt; 10 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold10 &amp;lt;fit[+]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tibble [25 x 8]&amp;gt;    325.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you put it like &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like so much work! But, this way hides how much work it takes to write those 3 custom functions: &lt;code&gt;get_fits()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;get_preds()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;get_rmse()&lt;/code&gt;. And we still had to use vanilla &lt;code&gt;map()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;map2()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;map2_dbl()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;make-it-better&#34;&gt;Make it better&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept a learning log while working through the all the above code, and I wrote down these notes to myself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very easy to do the wrong thing; it is very hard to do the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lost sight many times of what the code I was writing was doing, because I was using up so much cognitive energy on getting the code to just work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I knew how to use purrr&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have made it this far, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I don&amp;rsquo;t need to convince you that a better way to do cross-validation using tidymodels would be more pleasant to do more than once. It would also be less prone to error due to me copying-and-pasting repeatedly, and making stupid mistakes that would be difficult to spot with so much cluttered code. Luckily, 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://tidymodels.github.io/tune/reference/fit_resamples.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;tune::fit_resamples()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; came along to take a sad script and make it better:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;penguin_party &amp;lt;-
  tune::fit_resamples(
    rt_spec,
    body_mass_g ~ .,
    resamples = penguin_folds
)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the beautiful output from that function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;penguin_party
#&amp;gt; # Resampling results
#&amp;gt; # 10-fold cross-validation using stratification 
#&amp;gt; # A tibble: 10 x 4
#&amp;gt;    splits           id     .metrics         .notes          
#&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;list&amp;gt;           &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;list&amp;gt;           &amp;lt;list&amp;gt;          
#&amp;gt;  1 &amp;lt;split [225/26]&amp;gt; Fold01 &amp;lt;tibble [2 x 3]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tibble [0 x 1]&amp;gt;
#&amp;gt;  2 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold02 &amp;lt;tibble [2 x 3]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tibble [0 x 1]&amp;gt;
#&amp;gt;  3 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold03 &amp;lt;tibble [2 x 3]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tibble [0 x 1]&amp;gt;
#&amp;gt;  4 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold04 &amp;lt;tibble [2 x 3]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tibble [0 x 1]&amp;gt;
#&amp;gt;  5 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold05 &amp;lt;tibble [2 x 3]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tibble [0 x 1]&amp;gt;
#&amp;gt;  6 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold06 &amp;lt;tibble [2 x 3]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tibble [0 x 1]&amp;gt;
#&amp;gt;  7 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold07 &amp;lt;tibble [2 x 3]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tibble [0 x 1]&amp;gt;
#&amp;gt;  8 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold08 &amp;lt;tibble [2 x 3]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tibble [0 x 1]&amp;gt;
#&amp;gt;  9 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold09 &amp;lt;tibble [2 x 3]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tibble [0 x 1]&amp;gt;
#&amp;gt; 10 &amp;lt;split [226/25]&amp;gt; Fold10 &amp;lt;tibble [2 x 3]&amp;gt; &amp;lt;tibble [0 x 1]&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, to see all the stuff inside this &lt;code&gt;penguin_party&lt;/code&gt;, we can use tune&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;collect_*&lt;/code&gt; functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;penguin_party %&amp;gt;% 
  collect_metrics()
#&amp;gt; # A tibble: 2 x 5
#&amp;gt;   .metric .estimator    mean     n std_err
#&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;        &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;   &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;
#&amp;gt; 1 rmse    standard   305.       10 11.5   
#&amp;gt; 2 rsq     standard     0.869    10  0.0141
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see the predictions, we need to add use 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://tidymodels.github.io/tune/reference/control_grid.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;control_resamples()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;penguin_party &amp;lt;-
  tune::fit_resamples(
    rt_spec,
    body_mass_g ~ .,
    resamples = penguin_folds,
    control = control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE) # add this line
)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we collect the predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;penguin_party %&amp;gt;% 
  collect_predictions()
#&amp;gt; # A tibble: 251 x 4
#&amp;gt;    id     .pred  .row body_mass_g
#&amp;gt;    &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt;  &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;       &amp;lt;int&amp;gt;
#&amp;gt;  1 Fold01 3986.     4        3650
#&amp;gt;  2 Fold01 3986.    11        3600
#&amp;gt;  3 Fold01 3400.    14        3800
#&amp;gt;  4 Fold01 3986.    41        4400
#&amp;gt;  5 Fold01 3400.    54        3700
#&amp;gt;  6 Fold01 3986.    65        4300
#&amp;gt;  7 Fold01 3400.    70        2900
#&amp;gt;  8 Fold01 3986.    71        4100
#&amp;gt;  9 Fold01 3400.    76        3750
#&amp;gt; 10 Fold01 3986.    85        3775
#&amp;gt; # ... with 241 more rows
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, isn&amp;rsquo;t that better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m excited to be teaching a new workshop at the upcoming &lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.com/conference/&#34;&gt;rstudio::conf&lt;/a&gt; in January called &lt;em&gt;“Introduction to Machine Learning with the Tidyverse”&lt;/em&gt;, with my colleague Garrett Grolemund. Our workshop just sold out over the weekend! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is always hard to develop an entirely new workshop, especially if you are doing it at the same time as learning how to use a new API. It is even harder when that API is under active development like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tidymodels&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tidymodels&lt;/strong&gt; ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;! I’ve been so lucky to be able to work with the tidymodels team at RStudio, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/topepos&#34;&gt;Max Kuhn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.davisvaughan.com/&#34;&gt;Davis Vaughan&lt;/a&gt;, to help shape how we tell the tidymodels story to ML beginners. But my favorite part of developing a new workshop like this has been studying how &lt;em&gt;others&lt;/em&gt; teach machine learning. Spoiler alert: there are a lot of materials intended for learners that make things seem harder than they actually are! Below, I’m sharing my bookmarked resources, organized roughly in the order I think they are most helpful for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://vas3k.com/blog/machine_learning/&#34;&gt;Machine Learning for Everyone.&lt;/a&gt; In simple words. With real-world examples. Yes, again.&lt;/strong&gt; In my experience, the biggest hurdle to getting started is sifting through both the hype and the math. This is a readable illustrated introduction to key concepts that will help you start building your own mental model of this space. For example, &lt;em&gt;“the only goal of machine learning is to predict results based on incoming data. That’s it.”&lt;/em&gt; There you go! Start here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://vas3k.com/blog/machine_learning/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.vas3k.ru/7w1.jpg&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/&#34;&gt;A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning by r2d3&lt;/a&gt;. This is a wonderful two-part series (that I wish would be extended!):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/&#34;&gt;Part I: A Decision Tree&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-2/&#34;&gt;Part II: Model Tuning and the Bias-Variance Tradeoff&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://supervised-ml-course.netlify.com/&#34;&gt;Supervised Machine Learning course by Julia Silge&lt;/a&gt; Taught with R and the &lt;code&gt;caret&lt;/code&gt; package (the precursor to the in-development &lt;strong&gt;tidymodels&lt;/strong&gt; ecosystem), this is a great next step in your machine learning journey as you’ll start &lt;em&gt;doing ML&lt;/em&gt; right away in your browser using an innovative course delivery platform. You’ll also get to play with data that is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;iris&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;titanic&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;AmesHousing&lt;/code&gt;. This will be sweet relief because you’ll find the rest of my recommended resources all basically build models to predict home prices in Ames, Iowa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://supervised-ml-course.netlify.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juliasilge/supervised-ML-case-studies-course/master/static/social.png&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/&#34;&gt;Hands-on Machine Learning with R&lt;/a&gt; by Bradley Boehmke &amp;amp; Brandon Greenwell. Another great way to learn concepts plus code, although another one that focuses on the &lt;code&gt;caret&lt;/code&gt; package (pre-tidymodels). Each chapter maps onto a new learning algorithm, and provides a code-through with real data from building to tuning. The authors also offer practical advice for each algorithm, and the “final thoughts” sections at the end of each chapter will help you tie it all together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/images/homl-cover.jpg&#34; width=&#34;40%&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t skip the “Fundamentals” section, even if you feel like you’ve got that down by now. The second chapter on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/process.html&#34;&gt;modeling process&lt;/a&gt; is especially good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/process.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/images/modeling_process.png&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/&#34;&gt;Interpretable Machine Learning: A Guide for Making Black Box Models Explainable&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://christophm.github.io/&#34;&gt;Christoph Molnar&lt;/a&gt;. If you only have time to read a single chapter, skip ahead to &lt;a href=&#34;https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/simple.html&#34;&gt;Chapter 4: Interpretable Models&lt;/a&gt;. I also appreciated the introduction section on &lt;a href=&#34;https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/terminology.html&#34;&gt;terminology&lt;/a&gt;. But the whole book is excellent and well-written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/images/title_page.jpg&#34; width=&#34;40%&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model evaluation, model selection, and algorithm selection in machine learning- a 4-part series by &lt;a href=&#34;https://sebastianraschka.com/&#34;&gt;Sebastian Raschka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I found this to be a great evidence-based, thorough overview of the &lt;em&gt;methods&lt;/em&gt; for machine learning. I especially liked how he walks you step-by-step from the simplest methods like the holdout method up to nested cross-validation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2016/model-evaluation-selection-part1.html&#34;&gt;Part I: The Basics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2016/model-evaluation-selection-part2.html&#34;&gt;Part II: Bootstrapping &amp;amp; uncertainties&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2016/model-evaluation-selection-part3.html&#34;&gt;Part III: Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2018/model-evaluation-selection-part4.html&#34;&gt;Part IV: Comparing the performance of machine learning models and algorithms using statistical tests and nested cross-validation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, if you can read through the above resources and you are no longer feeling awash in new terminology, I think your vocabulary and mental model are in pretty good shape! That means you are ready for the next step, which is to read Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson’s new book &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.feat.engineering/&#34;&gt;Feature Engineering and Selection: A Practical Approach for Predictive Models&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.feat.engineering/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://images.tandf.co.uk/common/jackets/amazon/978113807/9781138079229.jpg&#34; width=&#34;40%&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, the later chapters in this book filled in a lot of lingering questions I had about certain methods, like whether to use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.feat.engineering/categorical-trees.html&#34;&gt;factor or dummy variables in tree-based models&lt;/a&gt;. But also don’t miss the section on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.feat.engineering/important-concepts.html&#34;&gt;“important concepts”&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning- this &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; feel like a nice review if you’ve gotten this far!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/&#34;&gt;Elements of Statistical Learning&lt;/a&gt;. The entire PDF of the book is available online. A great resource for those with a strong statistics background, and for those looking for more math and formulas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the highly visual learner, you may want to cue up some YouTube videos from Udacity’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAwxTw4SYaPnIRwl6rad_mYwEk4Gmj7Mx&#34;&gt;“Machine Learning for Trading”&lt;/a&gt; course.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just a spoonful of Hugo helps the blog go down.”
- me, only somewhat kidding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this series, I’m sharing small spoonfuls of Hugo that I have learned that hopefully can help you get your site &lt;em&gt;UP&lt;/em&gt; (and even better- more efficient, more streamlined, more automated). You can read the previous posts about my “Spoonful of Hugo” series &lt;a href=&#34;/post/2019-02-19-hugo-archetypes/&#34;&gt;about Hugo archetypes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;/post/2019-02-19-hugo-netlify-toml/&#34;&gt;Hugo versions&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;/post/2019-02-21-hugo-page-bundles/&#34;&gt;Hugo page bundles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are a few steps that I always start with to troubleshoot any blogdown/Hugo/Netlify problems. These steps would solve what I would anecdotally estimate as ~50% of blogdown problems that I see posted in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues&#34;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; and on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.rstudio.com/tags/blogdown&#34;&gt;community site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;update-hugo&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;#1: Update Hugo&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;fig:unnamed-chunk-1&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/syCa5ird7wp0c/giphy.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Don&#39;t be like this&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;
Figure 1: Don’t be like this
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If things have gone south and you are getting Hugo errors when you use the “Serve Site” Addin locally, it is possible that you need to update your version of Hugo. From R, you can check your Hugo version with blogdown:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;blogdown::hugo_version()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you can reference your &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo theme&lt;/a&gt; to find the minimum version of Hugo required by your theme:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;fig:unnamed-chunk-3&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;hugo-min-version.png&#34; alt=&#34;Check your theme&#39;s minimum Hugo version&#34; width=&#34;1073&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;
Figure 2: Check your theme’s minimum Hugo version
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can go higher than the minimum version though, so it’s good practice to update your Hugo, again from within R:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;blogdown:: update_hugo()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check your version again post-update:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;blogdown::hugo_version()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] &amp;#39;0.73.0&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are using Netlify to build your site using Hugo, you’ll want this version to match that- the best way to do that is with a &lt;a href=&#34;/post/2019-02-19-hugo-netlify-toml/&#34;&gt;netlify.toml file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;change-the-baseurl&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;#2: Change the baseurl&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/zG6MKhlBxIloc/giphy.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open up your &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; file and look for the &lt;code&gt;baseurl&lt;/code&gt; field, usually pretty close to the top. Here is mine&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;toml&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;baseurl = &amp;quot;https://alison.rbind.io&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if you are just starting with Hugo and don’t &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; have a domain name yet, try taking the advice that blogdown automatically prints out for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Warning: You should change the &amp;quot;baseurl&amp;quot; option in config.toml 
from https://example.org to your actual domain; 
if you do not have a domain, set &amp;quot;baseurl&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;/&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But be careful here- you shouldn’t leave it as “/”- once you do have your domain name you should update the baseurl as “/” is a not a valid URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;care-to-know-more&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Care to know more?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a quote from the person who writes the Hugo docs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…the only purpose for the baseurl field in the config is to define the full base URL of your website for deployment purposes.” - @&lt;a href=&#34;https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/how-not-to-specify-url-site/5691/7&#34;&gt;rdwatters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main error that would happen without the trailing slash in the past is that you would end up with a site where the theme’s CSS would be all wrong. This was probably because the theme designer used code like this buried in a layout file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link rel=&amp;quot;stylesheet&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;{{ .Site.BaseURL }}css/style.css&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if you set &lt;code&gt;baseurl = &#34;http://mysite.com&#34;&lt;/code&gt; but only rendered locally, things would look just peachy, because the default local server already included the trailing slash. So, the link in the html file would be&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link rel=&amp;quot;stylesheet&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://localhost:1313/css/style.css&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, at build, the link in the html file would turn into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link rel=&amp;quot;stylesheet&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;http://mysite.comcss/style.css&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which creates sites that look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;fig:unnamed-chunk-7&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47527626/52856178-f37a3680-3123-11e9-9b26-6500efac7404.png&#34; alt=&#34;Hugo tranquil peak theme&#34;  /&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;fig:unnamed-chunk-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/131&#34;&gt;GitHub issue #131&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4596214/26549134/7e3968fe-4445-11e7-90b1-87dd4ac2c1c0.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/114&#34;&gt;GitHub issue #114&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Hugo authors and theme developers have largely been moving towards using relative URLs instead of the baseurl to build paths. This was based on public advice voiced by the Hugo authors on the discourse forum. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The recommended way to reference resources is to use either relURL or absURL template funcs, which handles the slash issues.”- @&lt;a href=&#34;https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/0-19-to-0-30-2-baseurl-forward-slash-is-required/9206&#34;&gt;bep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following that advice, a more up-to-date theme would have code that looks like this buried in a layout file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link rel=&amp;quot;stylesheet&amp;quot; href=&amp;quot;{{ &amp;quot;css/style.css&amp;quot; | relURL }}&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;  → &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line? If your theme uses &lt;code&gt;relURL&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;absURL&lt;/code&gt; to link to site resources like CSS, JavaScript, or static images, then whether or not you include a trailing slash in your baseurl should not matter at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is some tough love about your theme: if the most recent version &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; still require the trailing slash in the &lt;code&gt;baseurl&lt;/code&gt; to “work” out of the box, I would seriously consider switching themes. This is a pretty good “canary in the coal mine” test regarding how up-to-date the theme author is, and how well the theme you have chosen adheres to Hugo templating best practices. If you are having pain with this now, it is likely not the only thing that will be painful about working with your theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;netlify-drag-and-drop&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;#3: Netlify drag-and-drop&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/DfbpTbQ9TvSX6/giphy.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can render your site locally but your published site looks different, try the drag-and-drop method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://arm.rbind.io/slides/img/netlify-new-site.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the “Serve Site” Addin, then drag-and-drop the &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt; folder straight into Netlify. What does this do? You can now see your public site…that you built…with your local version of Hugo. Netlify is doing none of the site building here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2019-03-04-hugo-troubleshooting/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first benefits of this approach is that it ensures that you are able to actually &lt;em&gt;generate&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt; folder locally! I have seen folks struggle to deploy the wrong repo. This simple step can force you to make sure to use the “Serve Site” Addin to generate the &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt; folder, and that the repo you are trying to link to Netlify actually contains a Hugo site because you must physically move the &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt; folder. But this method can also help you diagnose other problems too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt; folder &lt;strong&gt;does not render&lt;/strong&gt; on Netlify, you have work to do locally. I can’t tell you what it is as it can be a number of things, but you can be sure that your problem is not just the Netlify build- it is your local build too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt; folder &lt;strong&gt;does render&lt;/strong&gt; perfectly on Netlify, but you are getting a Netlify build error, then you likely have a Hugo version problem. It might be that the version you are running locally is more recent than the version run by Netlify by default to actually build your site. The good news is there is a quick fix for this! The solution is to upgrade the Hugo version Netlify is using- see my advice &lt;a href=&#34;/post/2019-02-19-hugo-netlify-toml/&#34;&gt;here for how to do that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are happy with how your site looks but you are missing content and/or seeing old deleted content, then you may need the next few strategies to troubleshoot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;torch-public&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;#4: Torch &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/YA6dmVW0gfIw8/giphy.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are seeing very weird things locally, try deleting your local &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt; folder. Then serve site again. Sometimes it can get “junked up”. I’ve found that sometimes deleted content can be a &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.rstudio.com/t/deleted-blog-post-still-showing-up-on-blogdown-website-in-index-html/14107&#34;&gt;little sticky&lt;/a&gt;. As recommended in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/local-preview.html&#34;&gt;blogdown book&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“you are strongly recommended to delete the &lt;code&gt;/public/&lt;/code&gt; directory before you rebuild the site for publishing every time, because Hugo never deletes it”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, this has a bonus of reinforcing for you exactly what the “Serve Site” Addin &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; - it regenerates the &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt; folder. This is also the folder that, if you are using &lt;a href=&#34;post/2019-02-19-hugo-netlify-toml/&#34;&gt;Netlify to build your site&lt;/a&gt;, is in your &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; file because Netlify (+ Hugo) generates this file “fresh” with each push to your GitHub repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/post/2019-03-04-hugo-troubleshooting/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;peruse-public&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;#5: Peruse &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/NS7gPxeumewkWDOIxi/giphy.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you notice weird things, try actually looking inside &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt;- don’t be afraid to spelunk around in there! If you are seeing something wrong with your site, try to figure out how blogdown/Hugo is processing and rendering your content. This folder can tell you a lot! Keep in mind that your local &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt; folder will still contain &lt;a href=&#34;#dates&#34;&gt;future/draft/expired content&lt;/a&gt; if you used the “Serve Site” Addin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;dates&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;#6: Back to the future&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;fig:unnamed-chunk-12&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/ek6obDm0IwjNm/giphy.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Where are my posts?&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;
Figure 5: Where are my posts?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your site renders beautifully locally, and your drag-and-drop site from &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt; looks the same, but you are missing key content when you actually deploy to Netlify using a Hugo build, you may have inadvertently stumbled into a Hugo date time warp. This is a fairly &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.rstudio.com/t/serve-site-working-but-posts-dont-show-up-on-github-io/11254/3&#34;&gt;common gotcha&lt;/a&gt;. Try using the drag-and-drop method again, this time first delete &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt;, then instead of using the “Serve Site” Addin, run this in your console:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;blogdown::build_site(local = FALSE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plop this &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; public folder in Netlify to see what your site will look like when it is actually published. What does this show you? Your local Hugo build (read: your &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt; folder generated by “Serve Site”) differs &lt;em&gt;by design&lt;/em&gt; in 3 important ways from your deployed site built by Netlify/Hugo. By default, &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/getting-started/usage/#draft-future-and-expired-content&#34;&gt;Hugo will not publish&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content with a future &lt;code&gt;publishDate&lt;/code&gt; value&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content with &lt;code&gt;draft: true&lt;/code&gt; status&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content with a past &lt;code&gt;expiryDate&lt;/code&gt; value&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that these are &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/&#34;&gt;defaults&lt;/a&gt;. The behavior of the “Serve Site” Addin is also documented in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/local-preview.html&#34;&gt;blogdown book&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is for you to preview draft and future posts locally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogdown’s &lt;code&gt;build_site(local = FALSE)&lt;/code&gt; differs from the “Serve Site” Addin in that it &lt;em&gt;will not&lt;/em&gt; render draft, future, or expired content. So your &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt; folder from &lt;code&gt;build_site(local = FALSE)&lt;/code&gt; shows you &lt;strong&gt;exactly&lt;/strong&gt; what Netlify &lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt; publish. Seeing it can help you troubleshoot why some content was showing up locally but not when you publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defaults are pretty sensible and nice to have, as you can still put these kinds of content under version control, and hence collaborate with other team members on the content without having the content publish (or expire) until you &lt;strong&gt;say so&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show content that Hugo was hiding, you’ll want to edit some YAML fields in the individual offending content files. For example, in the YAML of an individual content file (like a blog post), if you want to un-draft it, add or change this key/value:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;title: &amp;#39;A Spoonful of Hugo: Troubleshooting your Build&amp;#39;
author: &amp;quot;Alison Hill&amp;quot;
date: &amp;#39;2019-03-04&amp;#39;
draft: false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if you want to date something in the future (like to advertise the date of an upcoming talk) but publish now, you can use the &lt;code&gt;publishDate&lt;/code&gt; field. The &lt;code&gt;publishDate&lt;/code&gt; field is a newer addition to Hugo (&amp;gt;= v0.54.0) which, if left unset, will default to the &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt; field, which means in the individual content file YAML you can do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;title: &amp;#39;A Spoonful of Hugo: Get excited!!&amp;#39;
author: &amp;quot;Alison Hill&amp;quot;
date: &amp;#39;2025-03-04&amp;#39;
publishDate: &amp;#39;2019-03-04&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully these 6 things can help you get unstuck. If not, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.rstudio.com/tags/blogdown&#34;&gt;RStudio community forums&lt;/a&gt; are a great place to ask questions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes that’s right, I don’t have a trailing slash- read on for why I can get away with this.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just a spoonful of Hugo helps the blog go down.”
- me, only somewhat kidding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this series, I’m sharing small spoonfuls of Hugo that I have learned that hopefully can help you get your site &lt;em&gt;UP&lt;/em&gt; (and even better- more efficient, more streamlined, more automated). You can read the previous posts about my “Spoonful of Hugo” series &lt;a href=&#34;/post/2019-02-19-hugo-archetypes/&#34;&gt;about Hugo archetypes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;/post/2019-02-19-hugo-netlify-toml/&#34;&gt;Hugo versions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my third post in this series and it is breaking news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/dZCdA82qa8d4xVIwm3/giphy.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;hugo-page-bundles&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Hugo Page Bundles&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, not really breaking news, but you still may not know about it! Hugo v0.32 &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/news/0.32-relnotes/&#34;&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; a new feature called Page Bundles, as a way to organize the content files. Blogdown users rejoice that &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dvaughan32&#34;&gt;Davis Vaughn&lt;/a&gt; posted an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/351&#34;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; on the rstudio/blogdown repo to enable this option, which Yihui added shortly before rstudio::conf 2019 🎉. Here is the snippet from the &lt;code&gt;NEWS.md&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One benefit of using a page bundle instead of a normal page is that you can put resource files associated with the post (such as images) under the same directory of the post itself. This means you no longer have to put them under the &lt;code&gt;static/&lt;/code&gt; directory, which has been quite confusing to Hugo beginners.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does a blogdown/Hugo site begin to look like without page bundles? I think here is a representative example from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse.org/tree/master/content/articles&#34;&gt;tidyverse.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(sorry tidyverse team- it’s not you, it’s the old Hugo).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this team, they need an image for every post, which gets out of control pretty fast. Also, some ended up in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse.org/tree/master/static/images&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;static/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; too, organized by post (which I have done on my own blog, though not well or consistently).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would it look like to use page bundles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;content/
├── about
│   ├── index.md
├── posts
│   ├── 2015-07-23-hi-world
│   │   ├── bakers.csv
│   │   ├── image1.jpg
│   │   ├── image2.png
│   │   └── index.Rmd
│   └── 2015-07-24-bye-world
│       └── index.Rmd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could call this bundled file structure “tidier” 🍱.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above, after serving site, &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; files also get added to the bundle. In Hugo’s terms, these are &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/&#34;&gt;leaf bundles&lt;/a&gt;. The resource files allowed in a bundle include page and non-page items like images, pdf, .csv files, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is instead of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;content/
├── about
│   ├── index.md
├── posts
│   ├── 2015-07-23-hi-world.Rmd
│   ├── bakers.csv
│   ├── image1.jpg
│   ├── image2.png
│   └── 2015-07-24-bye-world.Rmd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you create a new bundled post, the actual content of the post goes in the index file of a page bundle. So:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# not bundled post
post/2015-07-23-hi-world.Rmd
# bundled post
post/2015-07-24-bye-world/index.Rmd&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;bundle-me-blogdown&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Bundle Me, blogdown!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, read the previous post on setting up a &lt;a href=&#34;/post/2019-02-19-hugo-netlify-toml/&#34;&gt;netlify.toml file&lt;/a&gt;. Since using Hugo page bundles depends on Hugo v0.32 or higher, you should go ahead and update hugo then update your netlify.toml with your updated version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;blogdown::update_hugo()
blogdown::hugo_version()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://usethis.r-lib.org/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;usethis&lt;/strong&gt; package&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;project-specific-.rprofile&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Project-specific .Rprofile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I’m going to demo here how to create a project-specific .Rprofile file- but know that you can do a user-level .Rprofile file too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# install.packages(&amp;quot;usethis&amp;quot;) # uncomment this to install
usethis::edit_r_profile(scope = &amp;quot;project&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These helpful messages &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; print to your console: please note the “restart” reminder…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; usethis::edit_r_profile(scope = &amp;quot;project&amp;quot;)
● Restart R for changes to take effect
✔ Setting active project to &amp;#39;/Users/alison/rprojs/alison.rbind.io&amp;#39;
● Modify &amp;#39;.Rprofile&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you could add this to your file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# in .Rprofile of the website project
if (file.exists(&amp;quot;~/.Rprofile&amp;quot;)) {
  base::sys.source(&amp;quot;~/.Rprofile&amp;quot;, envir = environment())
}

options(blogdown.new_bundle = TRUE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first code chunk above is from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/global-options.html#global-options&#34;&gt;blogdown book&lt;/a&gt;, where we describe a workaround for loading both user and project .Rprofile files (since R technically only reads one startup profile file).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t want this, you could add the blogdown options to your user .Rprofile instead using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;usethis::edit_r_profile(scope = &amp;quot;user&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heck, while you are at it, you could set a &lt;em&gt;bunch&lt;/em&gt; of options to make your blogdown life easier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# in .Rprofile of the website project
if (file.exists(&amp;quot;~/.Rprofile&amp;quot;)) {
  base::sys.source(&amp;quot;~/.Rprofile&amp;quot;, envir = environment())
}

options(
  blogdown.author = &amp;quot;Alison Hill&amp;quot;,
  blogdown.ext = &amp;quot;.Rmd&amp;quot;,
  blogdown.subdir = &amp;quot;post&amp;quot;,
  blogdown.yaml.empty = TRUE,
  blogdown.new_bundle = TRUE,
  blogdown.title_case = TRUE
)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the blogdown-specific options, any of these prepopulate content in your “New Post” Addin (I told you to use this &lt;a href=&#34;/post/2019-02-19-hugo-archetypes/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). There is a handy &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/global-options.html&#34;&gt;table&lt;/a&gt; from the blogdown book, summarized here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;blogdown.author&lt;/code&gt; = author of new posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;blogdown.ext&lt;/code&gt; = default extension of new posts (can also be “.md” or “.Rmarkdown”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;blogdown.subdir&lt;/code&gt; = theme-specific, you need to know your theme and content folder here&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;blogdown.yaml.empty&lt;/code&gt; = I told you to do that &lt;a href=&#34;/post/2019-02-19-hugo-archetypes/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;blogdown.new_bundle&lt;/code&gt; = what this whole post is about!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;blogdown.title_case&lt;/code&gt; = “nEed More coFFee” –&amp;gt; “Need More Coffee” (it tidies all your post titles to title case)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-newline-thing&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Newline Thing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a &lt;strong&gt;massive&lt;/strong&gt; .Rprofile gotcha: this file &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; end with a blank line. So make sure you add an empty line at the end of the file, then save it, and restart your R session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;restart-r.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to make your general R life easier in the future? Follow Yihui’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://yihui.name/en/2018/04/rprofile-trailing-newline/&#34;&gt;advice&lt;/a&gt; and do this in RStudio to ensure that all source files end with a newline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://db.yihui.name/images/rstudio-newline.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;use-bundles&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Use Bundles&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After restarting R, try using the “New Post” Addin, this time &lt;em&gt;with feeling&lt;/em&gt;. There is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; one more gotcha though. Use the Addin to create your new bundled post. The only catch is that once you are looking at your exciting new post, you should &lt;strong&gt;delete the slug&lt;/strong&gt; in the YAML (I posted an issue about this &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/370&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason is that you want the link to your post to be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://alison.rbind.io/post/2019-02-21-hugo-page-bundles/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you include the slug, the link to your post will be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://alison.rbind.io/post/2019-02-21-hugo-page-bundles/hugo-page-bundles&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option is to update your &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; file with permalinks like &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/configuration.html&#34;&gt;Yihui suggests&lt;/a&gt; (but beware: this will change all your past links as well, requiring some &lt;a href=&#34;https://yihui.name/en/2017/11/301-redirect/&#34;&gt;Netlify redirects&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[permalinks]
    post = &amp;quot;/:year/:month/:day/:slug/&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default here from Hugo was &lt;code&gt;/post/:year-:month-:day-:slug/:slug/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small note: if you want to add relative links from a blog post to another post in your same blog. So &lt;code&gt;[this](/post/2019-02-19-hugo-archetypes/)&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;a href=&#34;/post/2019-02-19-hugo-archetypes/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, add images and data files to your ❤️’s content! But you may want to do one more thing…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;update-metadata&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Update Metadata&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are anything like me, you may draft a blog post then come back to it later. For example, I started this post 2 days ago, but want to publish it today, 2021-01-13. The cool thing that was already built-in to blogdown is the “Update Metadata” Addin. With your blog post open (it should be called &lt;code&gt;index.Rmd&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, click on Addins and select “Update Metadata”. You should see a window like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;update-metadata.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check the box to rename the file if the date has changed. RStudio will tell you your file has been deleted- which is technically true since the folder was renamed, but don’t panic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;file-deleted-warning.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click YES. The &lt;code&gt;index.Rmd&lt;/code&gt; file that is now open should have an updated date field in the YAML. In your RStudio file viewer, you may want to click on “content” at this point then navigate back to view your post- then you will then see that the folder name now has an updated date too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Just a spoonful of Hugo helps the blog go down.”
- me, only somewhat kidding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the previous post about my “Spoonful of Hugo” series &lt;a href=&#34;/post/2019-02-19-hugo-archetypes/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In this series, I’m sharing small spoonfuls of Hugo that I have learned that hopefully can help you get your site &lt;em&gt;UP&lt;/em&gt; (and even better- more efficient, more streamlined, more automated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my second post in this series, and it is a relatively quick one. Just do this. This one is a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dataandme&#34;&gt;Mara Averick&lt;/a&gt; for alerting me that with Hugo version 0.54.0 and onward, there is a trailing zero at the end of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/5639&#34;&gt;Hugo versions now&lt;/a&gt;. So for versions before 0.54.0, use the format: 0.53; for later versions use 0.54.0 (0.54 will not work).
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;use-netlify-to-deploy&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Use Netlify to Deploy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you’ll need to use Netlify! I am a very happy Netlify user and currently have approximately 33 sites deployed. To setup a new account, navigate to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.netlify.com/&#34;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt; and click on the &lt;em&gt;Sign Up&lt;/em&gt; link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://arm.rbind.io/slides/img/netlify-landing.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sign up with &lt;em&gt;GitHub&lt;/em&gt; to connect your GitHub and Netlify accounts (as shown below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;netlify-sign-up.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use a different version control service, select GitLab or BitBucket instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last step is to use the Netlify UI in browser do &lt;em&gt;New Site from Git&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; pick your repo. You’ll be prompted to fill in these fields, they are probably already filled in correctly for you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;netlify-deploy-settings.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next part is the advanced build settings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;netlify-adv-build.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See that &lt;strong&gt;pro tip&lt;/strong&gt; about the netlify.toml? Let’s do that! You can leave these fields as is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;why-netlify.toml&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why netlify.toml?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.netlify.com/docs/build-gotchas/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build Gotchas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If your build works locally, the next debugging step is to ensure the package versions we use to build match yours. You can find the settings for these in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.netlify.com/docs/build-settings/&#34;&gt;Build Settings&lt;/a&gt; doc. That’s the leading cause of build failure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes that is right- package version mismatches are the leading cause of build failure with Netlify. What does this look like for blogdown users? This means that you are running a version of Hugo locally that doesn’t match the version that Netlify is using to build your site. Most of the time, you are using a more recent version of Hugo than the one Netlify uses. This means that the files your theme relies on may be using newer Hugo functions that were introduced in later Hugo versions- functions that Netlify won’t be able to find working from an older Hugo version. You’ll get &lt;em&gt;all the build errors&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check your local Hugo version by running this code in your R console:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;blogdown::hugo_version()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] &amp;#39;0.73.0&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we want Netlify to use this same version of Hugo when it builds your site. You can do this two ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do this in your browser (👎)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do this in your project root directory in a netlify.toml file (👍)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;add-the-netlify.toml-file&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Add the netlify.toml File&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding this file means that team members can see for themselves what version of Hugo you are running- if it is buried in the Netlify UI, you can’t see that information unless you sift through the public build logs (no thanks). Making the file as plain text in the root of your blogdown project directory means that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it is version controlled (yay!) and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;other people who use/learn from/contribute to your blog can &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; reproduce your site with the same site configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus:&lt;/strong&gt; you can set the Hugo versions for branch deploys too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is an example from my own &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rbind/apreshill/blob/master/netlify.toml&#34;&gt;netlify.toml&lt;/a&gt; file&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;toml&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[build] 
  publish = &amp;quot;public&amp;quot;
  command = &amp;quot;hugo&amp;quot;

[context.production.environment]
  HUGO_VERSION = &amp;quot;0.54.0&amp;quot; # if older, use format: 0.53 (no trailing zero)
  HUGO_ENV = &amp;quot;production&amp;quot;
  HUGO_ENABLEGITINFO = &amp;quot;true&amp;quot;
  
[context.branch-deploy.environment]
  HUGO_VERSION = &amp;quot;0.54.0&amp;quot; # if older, use format: 0.53 (no trailing zero)

[context.deploy-preview.environment]
  HUGO_VERSION = &amp;quot;0.54.0&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can leave off the last two chunk if you don’t want to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/11/16/get-full-control-over-your-deployed-branches/&#34;&gt;branch deploys&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/07/20/introducing-deploy-previews-in-netlify/&#34;&gt;preview deploys&lt;/a&gt;, but I ❤️ these two Netlify features and encourage you to try them out. I’ve starting drafting individual blog posts and tutorials in branches, and then I can see them rendered and share them for feedback without asking collaborators to clone and build the repository locally. It is &lt;strong&gt;lovely&lt;/strong&gt;. Every branch and pull request gets a link 🎉.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So add this file to your blogdown site repo and push to GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that, according to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.netlify.com/docs/netlify-toml-reference/&#34;&gt;Netlify docs&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During a build, the following ordering determines which context covers a particular deploy: UI settings are overridden if a netlify.toml file is present in the root folder of the repo and there exists a setting for the same property/redirect/header in the toml file.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look in your site’s Netlify deploy log, you should see entries like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;7:47:13 PM: Found netlify.toml. Overriding site configuration
7:47:13 PM: Starting build script
7:47:13 PM: Installing dependencies
7:47:14 PM: Started restoring cached node version
7:47:17 PM: Finished restoring cached node version
7:47:18 PM: v8.15.0 is already installed.
7:47:19 PM: Now using node v8.15.0 (npm v6.4.1)
7:47:19 PM: Attempting ruby version 2.3.6, read from environment
7:47:20 PM: Using ruby version 2.3.6
7:47:20 PM: Using PHP version 5.6
7:47:20 PM: Installing Hugo 0.54.0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;the leading zero matters for Hugo versions, so 0.53 works but .53 will not. For versions &amp;gt;= 0.54.0, the trailing zero also matters, so 0.54.0 works but 0.54 will not.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just a spoonful of Hugo helps the blog go down.”
- me, only somewhat kidding&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a happy blogdown user, a common story I hear from other #rstats users is that you try to change one little thing in Hugo, and the whole site breaks. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_be_dragons&#34;&gt;Here be dragons&lt;/a&gt; for folks who aren’t web developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Carta_Marina.jpeg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m here to tell you that there are small spoonfuls of Hugo that can help you get your site &lt;em&gt;UP&lt;/em&gt; (and even better- more efficient, more streamlined, more automated), even if you are not in the least bit interested in transitioning into a career in web development 😏.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;my-project&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;My Project&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The education team at RStudio needs a website and we have a short wishlist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want something we can maintain ourselves,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want to look consistent with other RStudio sites on the outside, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want to be consistent on the inside so that we can get help if/when we need it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This led me to the current &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tidyverse.org/&#34;&gt;tidyverse.org&lt;/a&gt; blogdown site. I wanted to make a copy of the site then customize for the education team, but I noticed that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse.org&#34;&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt; for the site didn’t make it easy for me to copy the &lt;em&gt;structure&lt;/em&gt; of the site and edit only the &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; of the site. This is one of the real strengths of Hugo, so I embarked on a learning adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://giphy.com/embed/VGG8UY1nEl66Y&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; height=&#34;392&#34; frameBorder=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;giphy-embed&#34; allowFullScreen&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://giphy.com/gifs/adventure-latin-flinch-VGG8UY1nEl66Y&#34;&gt;via GIPHY&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, I have been living and breathing Hugo lately. As in, my husband now recognizes &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mikedane.com/&#34;&gt;Mike Dane’s voice&lt;/a&gt;. You may not have have met Mike yet, but he appears in all the video tutorials in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/documentation/&#34;&gt;Hugo docs&lt;/a&gt;. His screencasts have been really helpful to me, like this &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/templates/introduction/&#34;&gt;one on templating&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve also spent a lot of time actually reading the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/documentation/&#34;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; (which are pretty good!), reading posts and answers on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://discourse.gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo discourse community site&lt;/a&gt;, and spelunking around inside the actual source code for two very well structured Hugo sites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The actual &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; site: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoDocs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://ropensci.org/&#34;&gt;rOpenSci&lt;/a&gt; site: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll be using this post and other later posts to share some of the things I’ve learned about Hugo along the way. Mainly breadcrumbs to myself, but I hope these help other people too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For reference, I’m using Hugo via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/&#34;&gt;blogdown R package&lt;/a&gt;, and within the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop&#34;&gt;RStudio IDE&lt;/a&gt;. These are my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown&#34;&gt;blogdown&lt;/a&gt; and Hugo versions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;packageVersion(&amp;quot;blogdown&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] &amp;#39;0.20&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;blogdown::hugo_version()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## [1] &amp;#39;0.73.0&amp;#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;tldr-a-teaspoon-of-archetypes&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;tl;dr: A Teaspoon of Archetypes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add custom archetypes as &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt; files to your project root directory (do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; touch the &lt;code&gt;archetypes&lt;/code&gt; folder in your &lt;code&gt;themes/archetypes&lt;/code&gt; folder).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don’t have that as an empty folder in your project root, make one, then add your archetype files to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are making a new blogdown site, I recommend using &lt;a href=&#34;https://arm.rbind.io/slides/blogdown.html#start-here&#34;&gt;these options&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;keep your empty directories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(blogdown)
new_site(theme = &amp;quot;jpescador/hugo-future-imperfect&amp;quot;, 
         sample = TRUE, 
         theme_example = TRUE, 
         empty_dirs = TRUE, # this!
         to_yaml = TRUE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;&lt;span id=&#34;fig:proj-wizard&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://arm.rbind.io/slides/img/blogdown-workflow-wizard.png&#34; alt=&#34;Using the RStudio Project Wizard&#34;  /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;
Figure 1: Using the RStudio Project Wizard
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the “New Post” Addin in RStudio to create &lt;strong&gt;any and all&lt;/strong&gt; new content for your site (not just &lt;em&gt;posts&lt;/em&gt;!). Be sure to use the handy dropdown menu to select from all the possible archetypes. Also, careful about the subdirectory here- some themes use &lt;em&gt;blog&lt;/em&gt;, others use &lt;em&gt;news&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;articles&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;posts&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://arm.rbind.io/slides/img/blogdown-newpost-bundle.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your archetypes, while only markdown files, &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; include R code. When you use the Addin, be sure to choose &lt;code&gt;R Markdown (.Rmd)&lt;/code&gt; as the format so that you can run the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t miss this &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/03/08/blogdown-archetype-template/&#34;&gt;great blog post&lt;/a&gt; by my friend and the great educator &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fellgernon&#34;&gt;Leo Collado-Torres&lt;/a&gt; on archetypes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;a-tablespoon-of-archetypes&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A Tablespoon of Archetypes&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the easiest things you can do for yourself is customize your site’s archetypes. From the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/&#34;&gt;Hugo docs&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Archetypes are templates used when creating new content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right away when I cloned the tidyverse site, I noticed that there were instructions for how to contribute a new article (or blog post) in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse.org/blob/c0eb070017cab794029b8ed3ac518f6e1a245a2b/README.md&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and in a separate &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse.org/blob/c0eb070017cab794029b8ed3ac518f6e1a245a2b/CONTRIBUTING.md&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CONTRIBUTING.md&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; file. Then I noticed this &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse.org/issues/113&#34;&gt;open GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dataandme&#34;&gt;Mara Averick&lt;/a&gt; (the tidyverse developer advocate) titled “Fix README/CONTRIBUTING so there’s one source of mechanical info?”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also noticed that there was no project root folder called &lt;code&gt;archetypes&lt;/code&gt;, which is where you would store your custom site archetype files as &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt; files. In fact, there is no &lt;strong&gt;theme&lt;/strong&gt; folder as you might expect either, which is where you could view the default theme archetypes. Let’s look at some from other Hugo themes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The default Hugo theme for blogdown, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium&#34;&gt;Lithium&lt;/a&gt;, has just one archetype: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium/tree/master/archetypes&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;default.md&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic&#34;&gt;Hugo Academic theme&lt;/a&gt; has A LOT: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/tree/master/archetypes&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/tree/master/archetypes&lt;/a&gt;; here is the content of the one for new posts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick note: you may have noticed differences in both the content between these two files but also the structure. The first is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/&#34;&gt;YAML file&lt;/a&gt;, the second is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/toml/&#34;&gt;TOML file&lt;/a&gt;. For blogdown users, you may want to use YAML. This is also why I recommend when you set up your site to use the &lt;code&gt;to_yaml = TRUE&lt;/code&gt; option (in the Project Wizard from figure &lt;a href=&#34;#fig:proj-wizard&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, check the “Convert all metadata to YAML” box; otherwise, the exampleSite will contain TOML instead of YAML)&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read the original tidyverse &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse.org/blob/c0eb070017cab794029b8ed3ac518f6e1a245a2b/CONTRIBUTING.md&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CONTRIBUTING.md&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; file, the instructions include a fair bit of R code that I would guess means a lot of copying and pasting into new posts. For example, the R Markdown setup chunk and the code for using &lt;code&gt;usethis::use_tidy_thanks()&lt;/code&gt; for package releases. I studied the contributing guidelines, and parsed three different “kinds” of articles that are commonly contributed, each with a different archetype:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;default.md&lt;/code&gt;- this is just for plain old markdown posts and basically sets up the YAML of the post to be the same as it is now (currently, there is no archetype dictating the content- it is pulling from a project-level &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse.org/blob/master/.Rprofile&#34;&gt;.Rprofile&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;default-rmarkdown.md&lt;/code&gt; which should only be used with an R Markdown post and provides only the setup chunk at the top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;package-release.md&lt;/code&gt; which also should only be used with an R Markdown post and adds the &lt;code&gt;usethis::use_tidy_thanks()&lt;/code&gt; code chunk (this is pseudo-code so the default chunk option is set to &lt;code&gt;eval = FALSE&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I drafted a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse.org/pull/271&#34;&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt; that adds &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse.org/pull/271/commits/26a07ae881e57607e25ef0add77d0f5958a9c143&#34;&gt;these three archetypes&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyverse.org&#34;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tidyverse.org/&#34;&gt;tidyverse.org&lt;/a&gt;. Here is the “after” Addin view:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;archetypes-after.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s hoping Hugo archetypes make some things about adding new content to your site easier. There is no Hugo involved, other than realizing that Hugo will look first in your &lt;code&gt;themes/&amp;lt;THEME-NAME&amp;gt;/archetypes/&lt;/code&gt; folder, then in your project root &lt;code&gt;archetypes/&lt;/code&gt; folder next. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/apreshill/status/1083791211222073344&#34;&gt;DO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/apreshill/status/1078494406301212672&#34;&gt;NOT&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://arm.rbind.io/slides/blogdown.html#35&#34;&gt;TOUCH&lt;/a&gt; any files in your &lt;code&gt;themes/&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;a href=&#34;#fn3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref3&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may want to set up archetypes for your blogdown site if you have a “signature” R setup chunk that loads your preferred &lt;code&gt;knitr&lt;/code&gt; chunk options, common libraries you always load at setup like &lt;code&gt;tidyverse&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ggplot2&lt;/code&gt; themes you prefer (&lt;code&gt;theme_minimal()&lt;/code&gt; FTW), etc. This may be especially helpful if you have multiple team members contributing to a single site and you want their posts to have a uniform setup. Then archetypes can be a real time- and sanity-saver. Get more ideas from Leo’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://lcolladotor.github.io/2018/03/08/blogdown-archetype-template/&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; on archetypes. You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; also make &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/#directory-based-archetypes&#34;&gt;directory based archetypes&lt;/a&gt; if you use Hugo page bundles, which is a topic of a future post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn1&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These setup options are newish to the blogdown package: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio-education/arm-workshop-rsc2019/issues/8&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://github.com/rstudio-education/arm-workshop-rsc2019/issues/8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn2&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you end up with TOML in your content files, run this R code: &lt;code&gt;hugo_convert(to = &#34;YAML&#34;, unsafe = TRUE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn3&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trust me on this one- if you ever want to update your site this will make that process way harder.&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-back&#34;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    A shorter version of this blog post now appears as an &lt;a href=&#34;https://readxl.tidyverse.org/articles/articles/multiple-header-rows.html&#34;&gt;article vignette&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;code&gt;readxl&lt;/code&gt; package, thank you to &lt;a href=&#34;https://jennybryan.org/&#34;&gt;Jenny Bryan&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/JennyBryan/status/1016442080636235776&#34;&gt;invitation&lt;/a&gt;!
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A problem I run up against a lot when working with other people’s data is having multiple header rows in the source data file. I like to use &lt;code&gt;readr&lt;/code&gt; functions to read in rectangular data like &lt;code&gt;.csv&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.tsv&lt;/code&gt; files, but if you skip rows at import using the &lt;code&gt;skip&lt;/code&gt; argument, you lose the header row as well, which usually has column names. The problem I often have is that the header row has column names that I want to keep, but I’d like to skip the second row (or more), which has some junk in it. Usually this row is some kind of data dictionary inserted between the row of column names and the actual data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I’ll walk through a solution to this problem, using the &lt;code&gt;readr&lt;/code&gt; package. You can also watch along in the video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mayf_XhsQDE&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warning!: I made a mistake when I said &lt;code&gt;readr&lt;/code&gt; uses the first 100 rows of your data to predict column types- it uses the first 1000 rows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Being sticker rich&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dataset is from an article published in PLOS ONE called &lt;a href=&#34;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0138928&#34;&gt;“Being Sticker Rich: Numerical Context Influences Children’s Sharing Behavior”&lt;/a&gt;. In this study, children (ages 3–11) received a small (12, “sticker poor”) or large (30, “sticker rich”) number of stickers, and were then given the opportunity to share their windfall with either one or multiple anonymous recipients. This type of experimental design is a version of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator_game&#34;&gt;Dictator Game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;stickers-plos-one.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main research questions the authors explored were: do the number of available resources and/or the number of potential recipients alter the likelihood of a child donating and/or the amount they donate? But, in order to answer this question, we have to be able to read in the data! Luckily, these lovely developmental psychologists opted to share their data on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/LHAQ5W&#34;&gt;Harvard Dataverse&lt;/a&gt; as a tab-delimited file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you download the file, you can open it up in a plain text editor.
&lt;img src=&#34;stickers-txt.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also open it with Microsoft Excel.
&lt;img src=&#34;stickers-table.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;read-in-the-file&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Read in the file&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by creating a variable called &lt;code&gt;link&lt;/code&gt; to store the link to the data file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# create variable to store url
link &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;https://dataverse.harvard.edu/api/access/datafile/2712105&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file has a &lt;code&gt;.tab&lt;/code&gt; extension, so we know it is tab-delimited. This means that the right &lt;code&gt;readr&lt;/code&gt; function for reading this file is &lt;code&gt;read_tsv&lt;/code&gt;. Since we stored our link already as a character string, that is the only argument to the &lt;code&gt;read_tsv&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;#install.packages(&amp;quot;readr&amp;quot;)
library(readr) # load the readr package
stickers &amp;lt;- read_tsv(link) 
# spec()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we know the second row of data is wonky, but how can we see that in R? There are a number of ways we can go spelunking around into our data file. The easiest to print it. Since we used &lt;code&gt;readr&lt;/code&gt;, we have a tibble, which nicely prints to screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;stickers&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;code&gt;dplyr::glimpse&lt;/code&gt; can’t help us much, because we have one variable name that is ridiculously long (&lt;code&gt;absolutenumberofstickersgiven(Conditions1or3:Outof12;Conditions2or4:Outof30)&lt;/code&gt;). We’ll fix that with &lt;code&gt;dplyr::rename&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we are ready to diagnose the problem!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem&lt;/strong&gt;: the first row is not really data. It is metadata about the variables, and it is screwing up &lt;strong&gt;readr&lt;/strong&gt;’s ability to predict our column types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution&lt;/strong&gt;: we’ll use &lt;strong&gt;readr&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;read_tsv()&lt;/code&gt; function to read in the data twice. In Step 1, we’ll create a character vector of the column names only. In Step 2, we’ll read in the actual data and skip the multiple header rows at the top. When we do this, we lose the column names, so we use the character vector of column names we created in Step 1 instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;read-in-the-file-again&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Read in the file (again)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;step-1&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal&lt;/strong&gt;: we want to read in the first row only and save it as a character vector called &lt;code&gt;sticker_names&lt;/code&gt;. This row contains the correct column names that we’ll need in Step 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sticker_names &amp;lt;- link %&amp;gt;%

&lt;h2&gt;Step 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal&lt;/strong&gt;: we want to read in all the rows &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; for the first two rows, which contained the variable names and variable descriptions. We want to save this as &lt;code&gt;stickers&lt;/code&gt;, and set the column names to the &lt;code&gt;sticker_names&lt;/code&gt; object we created in Step 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Bonus data dictionary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an extra bonus, when you do have extra header rows, you can create a data dictionary using the &lt;code&gt;gather()&lt;/code&gt; function from the &lt;strong&gt;tidyr&lt;/strong&gt; package.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>


&lt;p&gt;So, you are doing an &lt;a href=&#34;https://rladies.org&#34;&gt;R-Ladies&lt;/a&gt; presentation…that’s awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-short-version&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The short version&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made an &lt;a href=&#34;https://rladies.org&#34;&gt;R-Ladies&lt;/a&gt; theme for &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/yihui/xaringan&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;xaringan&lt;/strong&gt; slides&lt;/a&gt;. My original tweet about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;if you want to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/xieyihui?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@xieyihui&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s awesome &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/xaringan?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#xaringan&lt;/a&gt; package for &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#rstats&lt;/a&gt; slides but want more &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/Rladies?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#Rladies&lt;/a&gt; flavor, there is now a built-in theme for that (with code highlighting)! Thanks to the awesome &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/RLadiesGlobal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@RLadiesGlobal&lt;/a&gt; starter kit. Update the CSS in your YAML to use  🧙🏽‍♀️🧞‍♀️ &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/YnlGSVAMsl&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/YnlGSVAMsl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Alison Presmanes Hill (@apreshill) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/apreshill/status/935973869554487296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;November 29, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way to use the theme is to update the YAML like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: [&amp;quot;default&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;rladies&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;rladies-fonts&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure your version of &lt;strong&gt;xaringan&lt;/strong&gt; is up-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://alison.rbind.io/slides/rladies-demo-slides.html#1&#34;&gt;demo slide deck&lt;/a&gt; using the theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://alison.rbind.io/slides/rladies-demo-slides.html#1&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; height=&#34;400px&#34;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(view the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rbind/apreshill/blob/master/static/slides/rladies-demo-slides.Rmd&#34;&gt;source .Rmd on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-longer-story&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The longer story&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://yihui.name&#34;&gt;Yihui’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/yihui/xaringan&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;xaringan&lt;/strong&gt; package&lt;/a&gt; for slides. This is an R package, available through GitHub, for creating slideshows with &lt;a href=&#34;https://remarkjs.com/&#34;&gt;remark.js&lt;/a&gt; through R Markdown. This means that you can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;write all your slides in Markdown text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;include chunks of R code and rendered output like plots, results, tables, etc. in your slides&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;use git for version control and share your GitHub repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/yihui/xaringan&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;xaringan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ideal for an &lt;a href=&#34;https://rladies.org&#34;&gt;R-Ladies&lt;/a&gt; presentation!&lt;a href=&#34;#fn1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use the package, you’ll need the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;devtools&lt;/strong&gt; package&lt;/a&gt; installed so that you can use the &lt;code&gt;install_github&lt;/code&gt; function. Then do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;devtools::install_github(&amp;#39;yihui/xaringan&amp;#39;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Yihui points out in the documentation, if you use RStudio, you can use the menu to navigate to &lt;code&gt;File -&amp;gt; New File -&amp;gt; R Markdown -&amp;gt; From Template -&amp;gt; Ninja Presentation&lt;/code&gt;, and you will see an R Markdown example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first used &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/yihui/xaringan&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;xaringan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a few months ago. I was working with &lt;a href=&#34;https://yihui.name&#34;&gt;Yihui&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/&#34;&gt;blogdown book&lt;/a&gt;, and had signed up to lead a &lt;a href=&#34;https://alison.rbind.io/talk/blogdown-meetup/&#34;&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/portland-r-user-group/&#34;&gt;Portland R User group&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously, such a workshop could not have powerpoint slides, so it seemed like the perfect time to learn &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/yihui/xaringan&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;xaringan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my &lt;a href=&#34;https://alison.rbind.io/talk/blogdown-meetup/&#34;&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt;, I made a simple website for the newly founded &lt;a href=&#34;https://rladies-pdx.rbind.io&#34;&gt;R-Ladies PDX&lt;/a&gt; using blogdown (Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mmmpork&#34;&gt;Augustina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/deekshathati&#34;&gt;Deeksha&lt;/a&gt;, our fearless organizers). So naturally, my slides needed more purple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the R-Ladies run a tight ship- they have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit&#34;&gt;starter kit on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; that details all the pretty purples they like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;rladies-palette.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a month after I did the &lt;a href=&#34;https://alison.rbind.io/talk/blogdown-meetup/&#34;&gt;R-Ladies blogdown workshop&lt;/a&gt;, I saw this &lt;a href=&#34;https://yihui.name/en/2017/10/xaringan-themes/&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://yihui.name&#34;&gt;Yihui&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;yihui-xaringan-themes.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I thought this was such a cool idea and I hope more people make and submit themes. Then I realized, I had already made a theme! I submitted a pull request&lt;a href=&#34;#fn2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref2&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Yihui helped me make some edits to the CSS files to make them more parsimonious with the default theme, I electronically signed a contributor agreement, and now the theme is there for you all to enjoy and use! You use the theme by editing the YAML:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;output:
  xaringan::moon_reader:
    css: [&amp;quot;default&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;rladies&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;rladies-fonts&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use the theme and you are on twitter, I’d love to see it- &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?user_id=3199856542&#34;&gt;please mention me on twitter!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;TOC&#34;&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#read-up-on-blogdown&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;toc-section-number&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; Read up on blogdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#caveats-disclaimers-etc.&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;toc-section-number&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; Caveats, disclaimers, etc.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#in-github&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;toc-section-number&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; In GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#in-terminal&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;toc-section-number&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; In terminal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#in-rstudio&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;toc-section-number&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; In RStudio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#build-your-site-in-rstudio&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;toc-section-number&#34;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; Build your site in RStudio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#going-further&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;toc-section-number&#34;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt; Going further&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;read-up-on-blogdown&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;header-section-number&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; Read up on blogdown&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you start, I recommend reading the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;blogdown&lt;/code&gt;: Creating Websites with R Markdown&lt;/a&gt; by Yihui Xie and Amber Thomas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://amber.rbind.io/blog/2016/12/19/creatingsite/&#34;&gt;Making a Website Using &lt;code&gt;blogdown&lt;/code&gt;, Hugo, and GitHub pages&lt;/a&gt; also by Amber Thomas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also found this comment by Eric Nantz, the creator of &lt;a href=&#34;http://r-podcast.org&#34;&gt;the R-Podcast&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rbind/support&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;rbind/support&lt;/code&gt; issues section on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; to be helpful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rbind/support/issues/12&#34;&gt;https://github.com/rbind/support/issues/12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;caveats-disclaimers-etc.&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;header-section-number&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; Caveats, disclaimers, etc.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with all the great resources I listed above, getting myself up and running took a few tries, so in this post I’m passing along what ended up working for me. Everyone’s mileage may vary, though, depending on your operating system and your approach. About me: I am a macOS user, and I use R, RStudio, Git (usually via &lt;a href=&#34;https://about.gitlab.com&#34;&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes via &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;), and terminal regularly, so I’m assuming familiarity here with all of these. If that is not you, here are some places to get started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Git: &lt;a href=&#34;http://happygitwithr.com&#34;&gt;Happy Git with R&lt;/a&gt; by Jenny Bryan et al.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For RStudio: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.datacamp.com/courses/working-with-the-rstudio-ide-part-1&#34;&gt;DataCamp’s Working with the RStudio IDE (free)&lt;/a&gt; by Garrett Grolemund&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Terminal: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/veltman/clmystery&#34;&gt;The Command Line Murder Mystery&lt;/a&gt; by Noah Veltman, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://seankross.com/the-unix-workbench/&#34;&gt;The UNIX Workbench&lt;/a&gt; by Sean Kross&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/xcode/&#34;&gt;Xcode&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://brew.sh&#34;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; installed- &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/installation.html&#34;&gt;you will probably need these to download Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. If you don’t have either but are on a mac, this link may help:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/&#34;&gt;How to install Xcode, Homebrew, Git, RVM, Ruby &amp;amp; Rails on Mac OS X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I did not want to learn more about a lot of things! For instance, the nitty gritty of static site generators and how domain names work. I am a new mom, and just in the process of writing all this up, I filled up my tea mug twice with ice cold water, and filled my water bottle with scalding hot water. So, where offered, I followed the advice of Yihui and Amber. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/deployment.html&#34;&gt;“Considering the cost and friendliness to beginners, we currently recommend Netlify.”&lt;/a&gt; Sold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/netlify.html&#34;&gt;“If you are not familiar with domain names or do not want to learn more about them, an option for your consideration is a free subdomain &lt;code&gt;*.rbind.io&lt;/code&gt; offered by RStudio, Inc.”&lt;/a&gt;. Done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;in-github&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;header-section-number&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; In GitHub&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;blogdown-signpost-1.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go online to your &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; account, and create a new repository (check to initialize with a &lt;code&gt;README&lt;/code&gt; but don’t add &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt;- this will be taken care of later). For naming your repo, consider your future deployment plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are going to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.netlify.com&#34;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt; to host the site, you can name this repository anything you want!
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    You can see some of the repo names used by members of the &lt;code&gt;rbind&lt;/code&gt; organization &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rbind/repositories&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to host your site as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com&#34;&gt;GitHub Page&lt;/a&gt;, you should name your repository &lt;code&gt;yourgithubusername.github.io&lt;/code&gt; (so mine would have been &lt;code&gt;apreshill.github.io&lt;/code&gt;). If you are going this route, I suggest you follow &lt;a href=&#34;https://proquestionasker.github.io/blog/Making_Site/&#34;&gt;Amber’s instructions&lt;/a&gt; instead of mine!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;github-new-repo.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Screenshot above: Creating a new repository in GitHub&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34; style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go to the main page of your new repository, and under the repository name, click the green &lt;strong&gt;Clone or download&lt;/strong&gt; button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;Clone with HTTPs&lt;/strong&gt; section, click on the clipboard icon to copy the clone URL for your new repository. You’ll paste this text into terminal in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;in-terminal&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;header-section-number&#34;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; In terminal&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;blogdown-signpost-2.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you will &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/&#34;&gt;clone your remote repository&lt;/a&gt; and create a local copy on your computer so you can sync between the two locations (using terminal or your alternative command line tool for a Windows machine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; to navigate into the directory where you want your repo to be&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once there, type: &lt;code&gt;git clone [paste]&lt;/code&gt;. So my command looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/apreshill/apreshill.git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is what printed to my terminal window:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Cloning into &amp;#39;apreshill&amp;#39;...
remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Checking connectivity... done.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34; style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close terminal, you are done in there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;in-rstudio&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;header-section-number&#34;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; In RStudio&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;blogdown-signpost-3.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;code&gt;blogdown&lt;/code&gt; from your RStudio console. If you already have &lt;code&gt;devtools&lt;/code&gt; installed like I did, you can just use the second line below:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (!requireNamespace(&amp;quot;devtools&amp;quot;)) install.packages(&amp;quot;devtools&amp;quot;)
devtools::install_github(&amp;quot;rstudio/blogdown&amp;quot;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34; style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install Hugo using the &lt;code&gt;blogdown&lt;/code&gt; package helper function:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;blogdown::install_hugo()
# or
library(blogdown)
install_hugo()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    This is where my instructions diverge from Ed’s- he states that &lt;code&gt;blogdown&lt;/code&gt; won’t create a website in your root folder because the &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt; file is already there. I didn’t find that to be the case- I tested this with a new site as well. If one way doesn’t work for you, try the other!
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34; style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the top menu buttons in RStudio to select &lt;code&gt;File -&amp;gt; New Project -&amp;gt; Existing Directory&lt;/code&gt;, then browse to the directory on your computer where your GitHub repo is and click on the &lt;strong&gt;Create Project&lt;/strong&gt; button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;r-project-existing-directory.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Screenshot above: Creating a new project in an existing directory in RStudio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34; style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now you should be “in” your project in RStudio. If you are using git for version control, edit your &lt;code&gt;*gitignore&lt;/code&gt; file. This file should be viewable in your file viewer pane in RStudio. Below is what it should look like: the first four lines will automatically be in this file if you have set up your RStudio Project, but if you plan to use Netlify to deploy, you need to add the &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt; line (&lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/version-control.html&#34;&gt;read about here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.Rproj.user
.Rhistory
.RData
.Ruserdata
blogdown
.DS_Store # if a windows user, Thumbs.db instead
public/ # if using Netlify&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;build-your-site-in-rstudio&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;header-section-number&#34;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; Build your site in RStudio&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;blogdown-signpost-4.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can finally build your site using the &lt;code&gt;blogdown::new_site()&lt;/code&gt; function. But &lt;strong&gt;first&lt;/strong&gt; you should at least think about themes…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;picking-a-theme&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;header-section-number&#34;&gt;6.1&lt;/span&gt; Picking a theme&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are over 90 &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo themes&lt;/a&gt;. So I went back to the &lt;code&gt;blogdown&lt;/code&gt; book. Thankfully, Yihui and Amber offer &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/other-themes.html&#34;&gt;“to save you some time, we list a few themes below that match our taste…”&lt;/a&gt;. Huzzah- I went with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic&#34;&gt;hugo-academic&lt;/a&gt;! Whatever theme you choose, you’ll need to pick one of 3 ways to make your new site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are happy with the default theme, which is the lithium theme, you can use:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;blogdown::new_site() # default theme is lithium&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34; style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want a theme other than the default, you can specify the theme at the same time as you call the &lt;code&gt;new_site&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# for example, create a new site with the academic theme
blogdown::new_site(theme = &amp;quot;gcushen/hugo-academic&amp;quot;, theme_example = TRUE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34; style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If instead you want to add the theme later (like I did, because I didn’t see the above example until it was too late!), you can do this:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(blogdown)
new_site() # default theme is lithium
# need to stop serving so can use the console again
install_theme(&amp;quot;gcushen/hugo-academic&amp;quot;, theme_example = TRUE, update_config = TRUE)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    Now is a good time to re-read about &lt;code&gt;blogdown::serve_site()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/a-quick-example.html&#34;&gt;how &lt;em&gt;LiveReload&lt;/em&gt; works&lt;/a&gt; (and how it blocks your R console by default)
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend setting &lt;code&gt;theme_example = TRUE&lt;/code&gt;- some themes won’t provide an example site, but the academic theme did and I found it helpful to see. You can always delete the example content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;update-project-options&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;header-section-number&#34;&gt;6.2&lt;/span&gt; Update project options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your project in RStudio, go to the top menu bar of RStudio and select &lt;code&gt;Tools -&amp;gt; Project Options&lt;/code&gt; and update following &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/rstudio-ide.html#fig:project-options&#34;&gt;Yihui and Amber’s instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;edit-your-configurations&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;header-section-number&#34;&gt;6.3&lt;/span&gt; Edit your configurations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relevant reading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/configuration.html&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;blogdown&lt;/code&gt; book chapter on configuration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://proquestionasker.github.io/blog/Making_Site/#site-configuration&#34;&gt;Additional detail from Amber&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can also view &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apreshill/apreshill/blob/master/config.toml&#34;&gt;my &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, edit the &lt;code&gt;baseurl&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; file. The URL &lt;em&gt;should always&lt;/em&gt; end with a &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; trailing slash. At this point, you probably haven’t deployed your site yet, so to view it locally you can use the &lt;strong&gt;Serve Site&lt;/strong&gt; add-in, or run the &lt;code&gt;blogdown::serve_site&lt;/code&gt; function. Both of these baseurls worked for me when viewing locally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;baseurl = &amp;quot;https://example.com/&amp;quot;
baseurl = &amp;quot;/&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-warning&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    Make sure that the &lt;code&gt;baseurl =&lt;/code&gt; listed ends with a trailing slash &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;!
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and edit all the other elements in the &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; file now as you please- this is how you personalize your site!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addins: use them- you won’t need the &lt;code&gt;blogdown&lt;/code&gt; library loaded in the console if you use the Addins. My workflow in RStudio at this point (again, just viewing locally because we haven’t deployed yet) works best like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the RStudio project for the site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;strong&gt;Serve Site&lt;/strong&gt; add-in (only once due to the magic of &lt;em&gt;LiveReload&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View site in the RStudio viewer pane, and open in a new browser window while I work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select existing files to edit using the file pane in RStudio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After making changes, click the save button (don’t &lt;code&gt;knit&lt;/code&gt;!)- the console will reload, the viewer pane will update, and if you hit refresh in the browser your local view will also be updated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When happy with changes, add/commit/push changes to GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having &lt;code&gt;blogdown::serve_site&lt;/code&gt; running locally with &lt;em&gt;LiveReload&lt;/em&gt; is especially useful as you can immediately see if you have totally screwed up. For example, in editing my &lt;code&gt;about.md&lt;/code&gt; file, this error popped up in my console after making a change and I was able to fix the error right away:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Started building sites ...
ERROR 2017/06/08 16:22:34 failed to parse page metadata for home/about.md: (18, 6): missing comma
Error: Error building site: Errors reading pages: Error: failed to parse page metadata for home/about.md: (18, 6): missing comma for about.md&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above workflow is only for editing existing files or posts, but not for &lt;strong&gt;creating new posts&lt;/strong&gt;. For that, read on…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;posting&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;header-section-number&#34;&gt;6.5&lt;/span&gt; Posting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the &lt;strong&gt;New Post&lt;/strong&gt; addin. But, you need the console to do this, so you have to stop &lt;code&gt;blogdown::serve_site&lt;/code&gt; by clicking on the red &lt;strong&gt;Stop&lt;/strong&gt; button first. The Addin is a Shiny interface that runs this code in your console: &lt;code&gt;blogdown:::new_post_addin()&lt;/code&gt;. So, your console needs to be unblocked for it to run. You also need to be “in” your RStudio project or it won’t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;draft-posts&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;header-section-number&#34;&gt;6.5.1&lt;/span&gt; Draft posts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relevant reading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/local-preview.html&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;blogdown&lt;/code&gt; book chapter on building a website for local preview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you do a markdown or R Markdown post (see below), you should know that in the YAML front matter of your new file, you can add &lt;code&gt;draft: TRUE&lt;/code&gt; and you will be able to preview your post using &lt;code&gt;blogdown::serve_site()&lt;/code&gt;, but conveniently your post will not show up on your deployed site until you set it to false. Because this is a function built into Hugo, all posts (draft or not) will still end up in your GitHub repo though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;new-markdown-posts&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;header-section-number&#34;&gt;6.5.2&lt;/span&gt; New markdown posts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick one of 2 methods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;strong&gt;New Post&lt;/strong&gt; addin and with the radio button at the bottom select &lt;strong&gt;Format: Markdown&lt;/strong&gt; (recommended)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the console to author a new &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt; post:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;blogdown::new_post()
blogdown::new_post(ext = &amp;#39;.md&amp;#39;) # md is the default!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the &lt;code&gt;?new_post&lt;/code&gt; arguments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;new_post(title, kind = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;, open = interactive(),
    author = getOption(&amp;quot;blogdown.author&amp;quot;), categories = NULL, tags = NULL,
    date = Sys.Date(), file = NULL, slug = NULL,
    title_case = getOption(&amp;quot;blogdown.title_case&amp;quot;),
    subdir = getOption(&amp;quot;blogdown.subdir&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;post&amp;quot;),
    ext = getOption(&amp;quot;blogdown.ext&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;.md&amp;quot;))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    Remember to use the &lt;strong&gt;Serve Site&lt;/strong&gt; addin again so that you can immediately view your changes with every save using &lt;em&gt;LiveReload&lt;/em&gt;.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;new-r-markdown-.rmd-posts&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;header-section-number&#34;&gt;6.5.3&lt;/span&gt; New R Markdown (.Rmd) posts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, you have your choice of one of 2 methods:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;strong&gt;New Post&lt;/strong&gt; addin and with the radio button at the bottom select &lt;strong&gt;Format: R Markdown (.Rmd)&lt;/strong&gt; (recommended)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the console to author a new &lt;code&gt;.Rmd&lt;/code&gt; post:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;blogdown::new_post(ext = &amp;#39;.Rmd&amp;#39;) # md is the default!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you edit your &lt;code&gt;.Rmd&lt;/code&gt; post, in addition to saving the changes in your &lt;code&gt;.Rmd&lt;/code&gt; file, you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; use &lt;code&gt;blogdown::serve_site&lt;/code&gt;- this is how the output &lt;code&gt;html&lt;/code&gt; file needs to be generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-warning&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    Do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; knit your &lt;code&gt;.Rmd&lt;/code&gt; posts- use &lt;code&gt;blogdown::serve_site&lt;/code&gt; instead. If you happen to hit the knit button, just &lt;strong&gt;Serve Site&lt;/strong&gt; again to rewrite the &lt;code&gt;.html&lt;/code&gt; file.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, your &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/output-format.html#output-format&#34;&gt;YAML front matter looks something like this&lt;/a&gt;; note that some but not all features of &lt;code&gt;rmarkdown::html_document&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/output-format.html#fn15&#34;&gt;are supported in &lt;code&gt;blogdown&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;---
title: &amp;quot;My Awesome Post&amp;quot;
author: &amp;quot;John Doe&amp;quot;
date: &amp;quot;2017-02-14&amp;quot;
output:
  blogdown::html_page:
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 1
    number_sections: true
    fig_width: 6
---&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    Remember to use the &lt;strong&gt;Serve Site&lt;/strong&gt; addin again so that you can immediately view your changes with every save using &lt;em&gt;LiveReload&lt;/em&gt; and your &lt;code&gt;.html&lt;/code&gt; file is properly output.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;adding-images-to-a-post&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;header-section-number&#34;&gt;6.5.4&lt;/span&gt; Adding images to a post&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to include an image that is not a figure created from an R chunk, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/45&#34;&gt;recommended method&lt;/a&gt; is to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the image to your &lt;code&gt;/static/img/&lt;/code&gt; folder, then&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reference the image using the relative file path as follows:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;![my-image](/img/my-image.png)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;deploy-in-netlify&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;header-section-number&#34;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt; Deploy in Netlify&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;blogdown-signpost-5.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deploying in Netlify through GitHub is smooth. Yihui and Amber give some &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/deployment.html&#34;&gt;beginner instructions&lt;/a&gt;, but Netlify is so easy, I recommend that you skip dragging your &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; folder in and instead &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/netlify.html#netlify&#34;&gt;automate the process through GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you are ready to deploy, commit your changes and push to GitHub, then go online to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.netlify.com&#34;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click on the &lt;strong&gt;Sign Up&lt;/strong&gt; button and sign up using your existing GitHub account (no need to create another account)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Log in, and select: &lt;code&gt;New site from Git -&amp;gt; Continuous Deployment: GitHub&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, Netlify will allow you to select from your existing GitHub repositories. You’ll pick the repo you’ve been working from with &lt;code&gt;blogdown&lt;/code&gt;, then you’ll configure your build. This involves specifying two important things: the build command and the publish directory (this should be &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More about the build command from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/#common-configuration-directives&#34;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;“For Hugo hosting, &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; will build and deploy with the version 0.17 of &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt;. You can specify a specific &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; release like this: &lt;code&gt;hugo_0.15&lt;/code&gt;. Currently &lt;code&gt;0.13&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0.14&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0.15&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0.16&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0.17&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0.18&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;0.19&lt;/code&gt; are supported. For version &lt;code&gt;0.20&lt;/code&gt; and above, you’ll need to create a Build environment variable called &lt;code&gt;HUGO_VERSION&lt;/code&gt; and set it to the version of your choice.”&lt;/em&gt; I opted for the former, and specified &lt;code&gt;hugo_0.19&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can check your &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; version in terminal using the command &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/overview/quickstart/&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;hugo version&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This is what my output looked like, so I could run version &lt;code&gt;0.20&lt;/code&gt; if I wanted to through Netlify, but I went with &lt;code&gt;0.19&lt;/code&gt; and it works just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ hugo version
Hugo Static Site Generator v0.20.7 darwin/amd64 BuildDate: 2017-05-08T18:37:40-07:00&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;figure&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;netlify-build-settings.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Screenshot above: Basic build settings in Netlify&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netlify will deploy your site and assign you a random subdomain name of the form &lt;code&gt;random-word-12345.netlify.com&lt;/code&gt;. Mine was particularly unfortunate, with the random word &lt;code&gt;garbage-collector-janice&lt;/code&gt;. You should know that you can change this; I changed mine to &lt;code&gt;apreshill.netlify.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    Anytime you change your subdomain name, you need to update the &lt;code&gt;baseurl&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; file (so I changed mine to baseurl = “&lt;a href=&#34;https://apreshill.netlify.com/&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://apreshill.netlify.com/&#34;&gt;https://apreshill.netlify.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;”).
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you should be up and running with &lt;code&gt;blogdown&lt;/code&gt;, GitHub, and Netlify, but here are some ideas if you want to go further…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;going-further&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;header-section-number&#34;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt; Going further&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;custom-css&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;header-section-number&#34;&gt;8.1&lt;/span&gt; Custom CSS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to tinker with default theme settings like colors and fonts. Every Hugo theme is structured a little differently, but if you are interested, you can check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apreshill/apreshill/blob/master/static/css/blue.css&#34;&gt;my custom css&lt;/a&gt; to see how I customized the academic theme, which provides a way to link to a custom CSS file in the &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  # Link custom CSS and JS assets
  #   (relative to /static/css and /static/js respectively)
  custom_css = [&amp;quot;blue.css&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;formspree&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;header-section-number&#34;&gt;8.2&lt;/span&gt; Formspree&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://formspree.io&#34;&gt;Formspree&lt;/a&gt; to make a contact form, which is an online service (managed on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/formspree/formspree&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;) that allows you to add an HTML form to your static site. No registration, just use the form and confirm your email address once. I added the following code into &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apreshill/apreshill/blob/master/themes/hugo-academic/layouts/partials/widgets/contact.html&#34;&gt;my contact widget&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;form action=&amp;quot;https://formspree.io/your@email.com&amp;quot; method=&amp;quot;POST&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;label for=&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Your name: &amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;input type=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; name=&amp;quot;name&amp;quot; required=&amp;quot;required&amp;quot; placeholder=&amp;quot;here&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;label for=&amp;quot;email&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Your email: &amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;input type=&amp;quot;email&amp;quot; name=&amp;quot;_replyto&amp;quot; required=&amp;quot;required&amp;quot; placeholder=&amp;quot;here&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;label for=&amp;quot;message&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Your message:&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;textarea rows=&amp;quot;4&amp;quot; name=&amp;quot;message&amp;quot; id=&amp;quot;message&amp;quot; required=&amp;quot;required&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;form-control&amp;quot; placeholder=&amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t wait to read this!&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;input type=&amp;quot;hidden&amp;quot; name=&amp;quot;_next&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;/html/thanks.html&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;input type=&amp;quot;submit&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;Send&amp;quot; name=&amp;quot;submit&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;btn btn-primary btn-outline&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;input type=&amp;quot;hidden&amp;quot; name=&amp;quot;_subject&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;Website message&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;input type=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; name=&amp;quot;_gotcha&amp;quot; style=&amp;quot;display:none&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;rbind.io-domain-names&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;header-section-number&#34;&gt;8.3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;code&gt;*.rbind.io&lt;/code&gt; domain names&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may want a different &lt;a href=&#34;https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/domain-name.html&#34;&gt;domain name&lt;/a&gt; than the one provided by Netlify. I opted for a free subdomain &lt;code&gt;*.rbind.io&lt;/code&gt; offered by RStudio. To do the same, head over to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rbind/support/issues&#34;&gt;rbind/support GitHub page&lt;/a&gt; and open a new issue. All you need to do is let them know what your Netlify subdomain name is (&lt;code&gt;*.netlify.com&lt;/code&gt;), and what you want your subdomain name to be (&lt;code&gt;*.rbind.io&lt;/code&gt;). The &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.rbind.io&#34;&gt;awesome &lt;code&gt;rbind&lt;/code&gt; support team&lt;/a&gt; will help you take it from there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    Again, you will need to update the &lt;code&gt;baseurl&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; file to reflect your new rbind subdomain name (so mine is baseurl = “&lt;a href=&#34;https://alison.rbind.io/&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://alison.rbind.io/&#34;&gt;https://alison.rbind.io/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;”).
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;rbind.png&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;have-fun&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;header-section-number&#34;&gt;8.4&lt;/span&gt; Have fun!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, don’t forget to just have fun with it. Happy &lt;code&gt;blogdown&lt;/code&gt;ing!&lt;/p&gt;
